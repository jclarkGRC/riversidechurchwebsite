			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The First Degree -- <i>Entered Apprentice</i> -- Symbolism</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why must we consider the symbols of the Blue Lodge initiation rituals and what they
				mean?  Because of their central place in Freemasonry.  In <i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 110, the authors quote Masonic authority Allen E. Roberts
				who says:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Symbolism is the life blood of the Craft ... It is the principle vehicle by which the ritual teaches Masonic philosophy and moral
					lessons.</i>
				</blockquote>
				and also Albert G. Mackey who says:
				<blockquote>
					<i>To study the symbolism of Masonry is the only way to investigate its philosophy.</i>
				</blockquote>
				as proof of this fact.  In the personal notebook of the former Mason I knew is the following:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Masonry needs the unfolding of its symbols and the revealing of its inner meaning for the perfect revelation of its hidden beauty.</i>
				</blockquote>
				The symbols are obviously key to a full understanding of Freemasonry.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let’s consider first the preparations of the initiate before he enters the room.  Why is
				his normal clothing and possessions replaced with the older, tattered, ill-fitting trousers and shirt?  And why is he "hoodwinked"?
				The answers to these two questions are related.  They are both representative of poverty and/or blindness with respect to the candidate’s
				grasp of truth.  Consider the following quote from Albert Mackey as cited by Jack Harris (<i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 41) speaking of a new
				applicant for the first Blue Lodge degree:
				<blockquote>
					<i>There he stands without our portals, on the threshold of his new Masonic life, in darkness, helplessness, and ignorance.  Having
					been wandering amid the errors and covered with the pollutions of the outer and profane world, he comes inquiringly to our door,
					seeking the new birth, and asking a withdrawal of the veil which conceals divine truth from his uninitiated sight.</i>
				</blockquote>
				In the ceremony itself we saw that the candidate is introduced to the Lodge room with the phrase "<i>who has long been in darkness</i>.”
				So then, darkness represents ignorance and error while light represents knowledge and truth.  These symbols are readily understood and
				their usage thus is certainly not original with the Masons.  These quotes are further confirmed by the personal notebook:
				<blockquote>
				   <i>	Masonic light removes darkness from the candidate’s mind.  (He is) admonished "Eye should not see until the heart has conceived the
					true nature of those beauties which constitute the mysteries of the order.</i>
				</blockquote>
				Also the items on the altar (the VSL, the Square and Compass) are called the "<i>Three Great Lights in Freemasonry</i>" (Tsoukalas,
				<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 51)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What about the "cable-tow" (a hangman’s noose -- creepy) around the applicant’s neck?
				While one internet article asserts that many American authorities (including well known Albert Pike) see nothing more than the practical
				usage of dragging a guy around the room, others give deep, complicated explanations for it.  Harris (p. 40) says the initiate (in some
				lodges) understands its length of six feet represents the distance from shore ("<i>a cable’s length</i>") that his body will be buried
				after having been mutilated for willingly revealing any of the mysteries of Freemasonry.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We saw some of the contents of the room as we described the ritual itself earlier but
				three items we did not mention are the three <i>Immovable Jewels</i> ("Immovable" means they are always in the same place in the temple).
				These items are pointed out and used in the instruction of the candidate.  The Jewels themselves are called the <i>Rough Ashlar</i>, the
				<i>Perfect Ashlar</i> and the <i>Trestle-board</i>.  The Rough Ashlar is simply a stone taken from a quarry in its natural state before
				being shaped or worked with the tools of a mason.  It "<i>reminds us of our rude and imperfect state by nature</i>" (Harris,
				<i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 56; Tsoukalas, <i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 56 both citing Masonic sources).  By the Perfect Ashlar (which
				is a stone taken, worked and shaped so that it is fitted for use -- likely a perfect cube) "<i>we are reminded of that state of perfection
				at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God</i>" (Ibid.).  The Trestle-board is what
				we might call an old fashioned draftsman table upon which plans and designs can be laid out.  By it Lodge members are:
				<blockquote>
					<i>reminded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on
					his trestle-board, so should we, as speculative Masons, endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules laid down
					by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the Book of Life which is our spiritual trestle-board.</i> (Ibid., p. 57.)
				</blockquote>
				<b>Note:</b>  Not all Lodges designate these three items as the <i>Immovable Jewels</i>.  The personal notes I have say instead that they
					are: the Square which goes to the east side of the temple; the Level to the west; and the Plumb to the south.  However, the notes do
					make reference to the Ashlars and the Trestle-board.  Once again this just reminds us there is no universal consensus or guide for
					all details in the Lodges yet most of the elements are present in all of them.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another thing we saw as we looked at the ritual itself was the candidate being led
				around the room three times by the members of the Lodge.  This symbolizes his "search" for light.  Harris (<i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 43)
				calls this the <i>rite of circumambulation</i> and relates it to the worship of the sun in ancient days.  The personal notebook also
				confirms this (another example of mixing the pagan with the sacred) and notes that this is why they start in the east and proceed to
				the west.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, having already seen the meaning of  items on the altar, we will consider what
				the lambskin apron represents.  There is some reference to geometric shapes and mathematical formulas in the way the apron is folded as
				well as a reference to the <i>All Seeing Eye</i> in the notebook.  However the primary symbolism seems to be for the Lodge member to be:
				<blockquote>
					<i>reminded of that purity of life and rectitude of conduct so essentially necessary to his gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge
					above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides.</i> (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 49.)
				</blockquote>
				It is worn over the loins (seat of the passions) and is to help the Mason to remember to stay pure sexually.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that we have seen a large part of the ritual of the <i>Entered Apprentice</i>
				(first degree) of Blue Lodge Masonry and some of the symbolism behind the objects and rites, let us take a moment to consider if there
				is anything contained in these things that should trouble a potential Christian candidate.  Let’s begin with the <i>hoodwink</i> and the
				associated symbols and sayings.  We saw that the covering of his eyes as he enters the room represents the fact that the candidate is
				in <i>darkness</i> which in turn refers to ignorance about truth.  The first question we must answer is what kind of darkness this is
				or, in other words, of what is he ignorant?  Members of the Lodge may argue that the ignorance is obviously of the teachings of
				Freemasonry.  That much is no doubt true.  But what do their teachings concern?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Steven Tsoukalas (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 51) the answer must
				be found in the Ritual itself.  It makes sense to consider the context to discover the meaning of a given statement.  In this case we need
				to see what the candidate is shown and told immediately after the blindfold is removed.  When it is lifted he finds himself before the
				<i>Three Great Lights in Freemasonry</i> and he is given specific information about these items:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Bible we take to be the rule and guide of our faith; the Square to square our actions; and the Compass to circumscribe our desires
					and keep our passions within due bounds with all mankind, most especially with our Brothers in Freemasonry.</i>
				</blockquote>
				From  this we can see the "light" the initiate is receiving has to do with spiritual and moral matters.  Therefore, according to the Craft,
				the candidate prior to being told these things was in spiritual and moral "darkness".  Also, the implication is that <b>only</b> through the
				rituals, teachings and secrets of Freemasonry is it possible for anyone to have light therefore "<i>only the Mason knows the truth ... all
				non-Masons exist in spiritual darkness</i>."  (Ankerberg and Weldon, <i>Cult Watch</i>, p.111.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is that consistent with what Christians believe?  What does the Bible teach about this?
				Consider the following passages: <b>Matthew  5:14-16;  John 8:12; 9:1-7; 12:46;  Ephesians 5:8-14;  Colossians 1:12-14;
				I Thessalonians 5:4-5.</b>  Throughout the New Testament believers in Christ are portrayed as walking in light because they know Jesus, who
				is the light of the world.  Jesus never taught that anything else was necessary in order to have light and to escape the darkness. Frankly,
				it would be troubling for me to know that a born again believer in Christ would be willing to acknowledge that he is in the sort of darkness
				that Masons are talking about. How could someone who has been given the spiritual understanding brought about by the indwelling Holy Spirit
				affirm that he "<i>has long been in darkness and now seeks to be brought to light</i>"?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this respect Freemasonry is similar to Gnosticism, an early movement within the church
				which claimed to have special knowledge that allowed those initiated into its secrets  to have a higher and more meaningful spiritual
				existence.  Anyone not in the "club" was an inferior Christian.  Gnosticism was eventually rejected as heresy by the church and, in similar
				fashion, this aspect of Freemasonry is also to be rejected as false teaching.  While Lodge members may deny or play down these allegations,
				it is clear that a thoughtful Christian should find that agreeing that he was in spiritual darkness until joining the Lodge would be
				unacceptable.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second major concern about the <i>Entered Apprentice</i> degree has to do with its
				teaching about how to become eligible to enter the <i>Celestial Lodge Above</i>, or what we would call <i>heaven</i>.  Several items in the
				first degree ritual allude or outright confirm how to accomplish this.  We saw the <i>Rough and Perfect Ashlars</i> which pointed out, first,
				our imperfection and unsuitability for the <i>Grand Lodge in the Sky</i> (another Masonic term).  In Freemasonry, Jack Harris notes that:
				<blockquote>
					Masonry never reveals the root cause of the reason man is imperfect ... The word <b>sin</b> is impossible to find in Masonry, except in the
					Knights Templar lodge, and there it is used in an unscriptural manner. (p. 57).
				</blockquote>
				Irrelevant to the purposes of the Craft for them to explain sin?  Perhaps.  Or perhaps not considering the fact that they do give
				instruction about how to overcome the imperfection:
				<blockquote>
					<i>By the Perfect Ashlar, we are reminded of the state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a <b>virtuous education, our own
					endeavors</b>, and the blessing of God</i> (emphasis mine).
				</blockquote>
				Obviously the way of getting qualified and of pleasing the Great Architect is to learn the right way to live and then perform.  The
				Trestle-board reinforces this teaching:
				<blockquote>
					<i>... by the Trestle-board we are reminded ... we, as speculative masons, <b>endeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the
					rules laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the Book of Life</b> ...</i>  (emphasis mine).
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Lambskin Apron certainly goes along with this as we remember that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>He ... who wears the Lambskin as the Badge of a Mason is constantly reminded of that <b>purity of life and rectitude of conduct so
					essentially necessary to his gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge above</b>, ...</i>  (emphasis mine).
				</blockquote>
				A tool and symbol we did not see before is the <i>Common Gavel</i> (a hammer used to break and shape stones) but used by members  to teach
				that Masons are:
				<blockquote>
					<i>to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities
					of life; thereby fitting our minds, as living stones, for the spiritual building, ... eternal in the heaven.</i>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is clear that Freemasonry teaches that one can enter heaven by good works or, perhaps,
				by becoming a good person.  That is a common misconception in the world.  What does the Bible teach?  Consider some scriptures that go to
				the heart of the matter: <b>Romans 3:23;  4:1-5;  Ephesians 2:8-9</b>.  God’s word clearly teaches that no one is able to be good enough
				or do enough good to offset or pay for their sin.  It is not possible for, because we are sinners by nature, we can never completely
				cease from sinning.  Our perceived righteousness is as "<b><i>filthy rags</i></b>" (<b>Isaiah 64:6</b>) before God.  Salvation only comes
				by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ.  It is not merited or earned, it is granted.  Of course,  Christians are certainly
				interested in doing good works (<b>Ephesians 2:10</b>) because after salvation God gives us a new nature and the Holy Spirit as an
				indwelling Helper.  But the motive can never be for the purpose of gaining heaven.  We do them to show our love and gratitude to our
				Lord in response to His great love for us.  We desire to become more like Christ, our great example.  While, to an onlooker, the outward
				result (integrity, honesty, purity, etc.) may look the same for both a Christian and a Mason, yet there is an enormous inward difference
				and an even more drastic eternal result.</font></p>

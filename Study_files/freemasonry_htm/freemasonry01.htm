			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Introduction:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This inquiry into the Masonic Lodge originated as a suggestion from a member in response
				to a question I posed to my congregation soliciting input and ideas for such studies.  After hearing the suggestion of Freemasonry I was
				intrigued myself and decided that I would pursue it and present my findings. The reasons for my interest are several:
				<ol>
					<li>
						This fraternal society is widespread with a chapter and/or lodge in nations all around the world, every state in the U.S.A. and,
						indeed, it seems in every small town throughout the country.
					</li>
					<li>
						Because it is a secret society characterized by secret passwords, handshakes, rituals, et cetera, there is  inherently a bit of
						curiosity regarding what it’s all about, the goals of the members, and what, if any, purpose the society serves.
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, it has been obvious that some Masons are also members (even leaders and pastors) of Christian churches and see no
						inconsistency.  People outside the society have been critical of this and say belonging to both the Lodge and a church is
						contradictory.  Which is correct?
					</li>
				</ol></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hopefully, we will be able to examine all these areas and get a clear picture of the
				influence of the society, what’s going on in the Lodges and, most importantly,  what should be the appropriate position of a Christian
				regarding Freemasonry.  My chief sources for this study include:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i> (P & R Publishing, 1995) by Steven Tsoukalas
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Freemasonry -- The Invisible Cult</i> (Whittaker House, 1983) by Jack Harris
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Cult Watch</i> (Harvest House, 1991) by John Ankerberg and John Weldon
					</li>
				</ul>
				along with various articles to be referenced as used, plus the personal notes of an acquaintance who was personally involved in the Lodge.</font></p>

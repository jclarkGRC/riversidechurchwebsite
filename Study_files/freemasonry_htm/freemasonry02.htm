			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Historic Background:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are several ideas about how Freemasonry began.  Some attribute the origins to the
				ancient "mystery" religions of the Egyptian and Greco-Roman cultures.  Others believe that in the middle ages the guilds of actual
				stoneworkers (referred to as "operative masons") began to allow laymen who were interested in other aspects of their craft (referred to
				as "speculative masons") to join and these men eventually come to control the lodges and use them to propagate their own purposes.  Some
				trace the beginnings back to Babel where masons were needed to work the stone used to build the tower until God intervened.  Others go back
				to the temple built in Jerusalem built by Solomon and credit the wise king with being the first most excellent Grand Master -- along with
				Hiram of Tyre whose help was needed to build the temple (<b>I Kings 5-9</b>; more on the Masonic legend of Hiram Abif later).  Finally,
				another factor is said to be the persecution of a group of crusaders, the Knights Templar, by one or more popes which drove them
				underground, helping to explain the emphasis on secrecy with the society.  Some use all these, and even go further back, teaching that
				all these events and people contributed and through them Freemasonry progressed to the present day version.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">None of these theories can be completely validated and most Masons agree that  modern
				Freemasonry is nothing like whatever might have been going on then.  Some certainly seem quite unlikely.  Nevertheless, aspects of all
				these ideas are contained in the Masonic rituals and offices.  As we will see there are references to ancient Babylonian, Egyptian, Jewish
				and Syrian cultures and religions.  Allusions to the knights of the Crusades are evident.  The layout of the Jewish temple of Solomon is
				copied for its lodges.  There is obviously an emphasis on the craft of masonry and the tools used by its practitioners as symbols in the
				teachings.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whatever one thinks about the ancient alleged roots of Freemasonry, most Masonic
				authorities will agree that the beginnings of the modern fraternal order came about in 1717 when the Grand Lodge of London was formed. Two
				ministers, Rev. James Anderson and Rev. John T. Desaguiliers, are often given credit as the founders.  It is thought by some that because
				these men were Protestant (Anderson was Reformed Presbyterian) the early version of Masonry was definitely Christian and that this lasted
				until the latter part of the nineteenth century.  Of course, the society was not fully formed.  The third degree was not developed until
				years later.  The two major rites, York and Scottish, were decades away.  Also, over time disagreements among the lodges caused some
				fractures and divisions.  There are several branches and factions of Freemasonry today as a result.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We should also note that there are many auxiliary groups connected with the Masonic
				Lodge.  Only men who are freeborn, twenty-one years old and without physical impairment may join the Masonic Lodge.  The other groups are
				open to spouses, children and other relatives.  Some are the Tall Cedars of Lebanon, the Square and Compass Clubs, the Order of the
				Amaranth, the Daughters of Osiris, the Daughters of the Nile, the Order of DeMolay (boys), the Order of the Rainbow (or Rainbow Girls),
				Job’s Daughters, the Order of the Eastern Star, and the Ancient Arabic Order Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (often called Shriners, limited
				to full York and Scottish Rite Masons), and several others.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Back to: <a href="freemasonry04.htm">Why the image of "masonry"?</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="freemasonry06.htm">The Blue Lodge</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Main Question</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly no one would or should be opposed to an organization which encourages men to do
				what’s right and to contribute to society in a positive way -- at least not on those grounds.  Further, we would concede that there can be
				no question that the organization has accomplished much good.  No doubt some have become better men because of their involvement in the
				Lodge and there have been worthy charitable endeavors which continue still today and benefit many.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to these factors, much store is apparently set by the Masons on the value of
				instruction from the Bible.  It is impossible to read Masonic literature for very long without seeing numerous biblical references.  In the
				same personal journal referred to above is a notation regarding "<i>The Holy Bible, the great light in Masonry</i>" and just below that
				"<i>The Basic Study of Masonry is the Bible</i>".  Again, we as Christians would certainly likewise affirm the immense importance of the
				Bible for instruction for life.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These things (morality, good deeds and Bible study) are obviously not problems for
				believers in Christ.  However, just because a movement or an organization has some good points does not mean it should be above close
				scrutiny or beyond critical analysis.  We know that one of Satan’s tactics is to mix in a little deception with a lot of truth in order
				to lead astray those who lack discernment.  Paul spoke of how it only takes a little leaven (evil) to affect the whole lump
				(<b>I Cor. 5:6</b>) where in the context he is telling the Corinthian Christians that if they tolerate sin in some of their members,
				sooner or later it will impact them all.  I must note that as I look through Masonic literature and books about it, it also does not take
				very long to find numerous references to other religions, their traditions and their holy books.  We will see some of these as we progress
				in the study.  Needless to say, it is troubling to see some of the ideas presented.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point is that no matter how much good is done by the Lodge, if there are some
				fundamental errors in Masonic dogma or teachings which would deny sound biblical Christian doctrine, then it must be rejected by believers
				in Christ.  Most members of the Lodge would object at this point. One common refrain is that in all their years of membership in the
				Masons and also as a Christian they have never found a contradiction between the two.  Is that true?  We will see as we next begin to
				present the teachings and rituals of the Masonic Lodge.</font></p>

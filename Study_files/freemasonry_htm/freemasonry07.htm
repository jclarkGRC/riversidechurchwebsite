			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The First Degree -- <i>Entered Apprentice</i> -- Initiation</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once a man has been accepted as a candidate for the Lodge, he must begin to learn some
				basic information and be initiated into his new station by means of a ritual.  In the ritual for the first and subsequent Blue Lodge
				degrees there are several symbolic objects either given to the candidate or used in his instruction.  As we go through the initiation
				rituals we will see several of these symbols (though not all because of space and other factors).  First, however, we will see the
				initiation ritual itself and, afterward, consider the symbols and their meanings.  Let me preface the following by saying that it may not
				accurately represent the exact practices of every Lodge but is a compilation of what seems to be most common.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to former Knight Templar and Worshipful Master Jack Harris
				(<i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 39-40) the initiate begins by being taken to a side or back room off the main meeting room by an officer of the
				Lodge, the Senior Steward, and perhaps some other members/officers.  He must remove all his clothing and personal items (especially
				anything metal)  and don old loose fitting trousers and shirt (white or blue according to varying sources) and slippers.  He is also
				blindfolded or hooded (the Masonic term is "<i>hoodwinked</i>") and a hangman’s noose is placed around his neck (called a
				"<i>cable tow</i>").  This stylish accessory is apparently used to lead the candidate around while blindfolded.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After being thus prepared, the candidate is taken to the door separating him from the
				main Lodge room where he knocks three times.  Another officer, the Junior Deacon, on the other side responds with three knocks, opens
				the door and asks, "Who goes there?"  Either the Senior Steward or the candidate himself (varying sources) answers with the following
				or similar:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Mr. John Smith, who has long been in darkness, and now seeks to be brought to light, and to receive a part in the rights and benefits
					of this worshipful Lodge, erected to God, and dedicated to the holy Saints John</i> (John the Baptist and John the Evangelist), <i>as all
					brothers and fellows have done before.</i>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The initiate is led into the main room where he is met by the Senior Deacon who holds a
				sharp instrument to his chest and repeats a formula warning him of the consequences of ever revealing what he is about to learn.  The
				Worshipful Master then leads in a prayer of consecration.  After that, the initiate is led around the room three times (once for each Blue
				Lodge degree) from east to south to west.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will pause here to note that the main meeting room of a Lodge is usually configured to
				represent Solomon’s temple.  Examples of this are that the room itself is set so as to be aligned east to west with specific articles of
				furniture put in certain places according to these directions and in relationship to each other.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is an altar with certain objects always on it.  The floor is usually tiled or
				painted in a checkerboard fashion to represent a stone floor.  There are columns or other objects representing the two pillars <i>Boaz</i>
				and <i>Jachin</i> of the original temple (<b>I Kings 7:21</b>).  Various other details are also followed to be in conformity with this
				general practice.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Returning to the ritual itself, after they have all finished marching the initiate is
				then led to the altar upon which rests a <i>Volume of Sacred Law</i> (or VSL, usually a Bible in the U.S.A.), the Square and the Compass.
				He is then informed he is about to take oaths and when he agrees he kneels and, with his hand on (or under) the three objects, swears to
				various things, among which, primarily, is a promise to not reveal what he is learning under the penalty of:
				<blockquote>
					<i>... having my throat cut from ear to ear, my tongue torn out by its roots, and with my body buried in the rough sands of the sea, a
					cable’s length from shore, where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours, ...</i>  (Jack Harris, <i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 45.)
				</blockquote>
				He then seals his oaths by kissing the VSL.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Afterward, the Worshipful Master asks, "<i>Having been in a state of darkness, what is the
				predominant wish of your heart?</i>"  The candidate answers, "<i>Light.</i>"  The response is, "<i>Then let that blessing be restored.</i>"
				The blindfold is removed and the three "lights" of Freemasonry on the altar are revealed and explained:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Bible</i> (or other sacred book) <i>we take to be the rule and guide of our faith; the Square to square our actions; and the
					Compass to circumscribe our desires and keep our passions within due bounds of all mankind, more especially with our Brethren in
					Freemasonry.</i>
				</blockquote>
				The secret signs, grips and password of the first degree are explained and demonstrated, as well as the meaning of <i>Boaz</i> (strength
				to produce), the left-hand pillar in the Porchway of Solomon's Temple and <i>Jachin</i> (wisdom to establish) on the right.  Note: Some
				sources place the sharing of the information regarding the pillars in the second Blue Lodge degree. Others say the meaning of <i>Boaz</i>
				is shared in the first and <i>Jachin</i> in the second.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The candidate is then presented with a white lambskin apron "<i>more ancient than the
				Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle</i>" which he then puts on over his old and simple clothing.  Throughout the rest of ceremony the new
				Entered Apprentice is taught moral virtues based on architectural analogies.  At the conclusion, as in each degree, is a celebratory
				dinner with much toasting, speeches and singing. There are other things happening and other objects present which represent particular
				truths throughout the ritual.  Some of these are sort of in the background (e.g., the Worshipful Master’s hat, where he sits, etc.) while
				others are brought out for the instruction of the candidate.  We will look at one or two as we next look at the symbolism of what we’ve
				seen in the initiation of the Entered Apprentice.</font></p>

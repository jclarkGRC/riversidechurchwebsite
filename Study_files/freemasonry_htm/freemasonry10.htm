			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is an extremely strong ecumenical spirit in Freemasonry.  Earlier we mentioned the
				VSL (<i>Volume of Sacred Law</i>) which is always in the main Lodge on the altar.  I noted that in the United States this is usually a
				Bible.  However, that is not always the case.  In a given Lodge in Utah it might very well be a Book of Mormon if the membership is
				comprised mainly of Latter-day Saints. If the Lodge happens to be in a nation where the primary religion is something besides Christianity,
				it is almost certain that the VSL will be something else rather than a Bible (a Koran, the Vedas, etc.).  The point is that Masons believe
				that all religions are equally valid because of their insistence on the <i>Fatherhood of God</i> and the <i>Brotherhood of Man</i>.  No
				true Mason will deny that.  Consider the following quote from <i>Freemasonry: A Way of Life</i> (published by the Grand Lodge of
				Massachusetts) as cited by Tsoukalas:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Though religious in character, Masonry is not a religion, nor a substitute for one. It fosters belief in a Supreme Being -- this being
					a prerequisite for membership.  Freemasonry accepts good men who are found to be worthy, regardless of their religious convictions,
					and strives to make better men of them by emphasizing a firm belief in the Fatherhood of God, the Brotherhood of Man, and the
					immortality of the Soul</i>.  (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 18.)
				</blockquote>
				And in the ritual lecture for the Entered Apprentice we see the following:
				<blockquote>
					<i>By the exercise of brotherly love we are taught to regard the whole human species as one family ; the high and the low, the rich and
					the poor; who, as created by one Almighty Parent and inhabitants of the same planet, are to aid, support and protect each other.  On
					this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise
					have remained at a perpetual distance.</i>  (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 70.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This attitude sounds very positive in many ways especially with modern man’s emphasis
				on "tolerance".  However there are necessary implications from such an approach.  First, for someone who comes to the Lodge without the
				benefit of true Bible knowledge, it would easy to get the impression that because God is <i>Father</i> of all and because we are all
				<i>brothers</i>, one big family so to speak, therefore we are all in good standing with God.  We have already addressed the fact that
				mankind, as depraved sinners, cannot get into heaven by means of their own goodness.  The sinful nature we are born with and the sin we
				commit stands between us and God until we are reconciled through the atonement Jesus provides (<b>Ephesians 2:1-3</b>).  Through the
				natural birth we are His children in the sense that He created mankind (<b>Acts 17:28-29</b>) but we need the second birth through faith
				in Jesus to be counted as God’s children in a spiritual sense.  It is that status as spiritual sons and daughters of God which grants to
				us eternal life (<b>John 1:12-13</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps a more direct issue to this discussion is that within the Lodge, God is never
				defined in precise terms.  He is never thought of in specific ways.  The website <i>mystae.com</i> quotes <i>Freemasonry - A Journey through
				Ritual and Symbol</i> by W. Kirk MacNulty:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Although Freemasonry requires each of its Candidates to confirm his belief in God, it does not expand on the subject but leaves
					religion and its practice to the individual Mason. As a result, men of all religious persuasions have been able to join in the
					study of Freemasonry's moral and philosophical principles.</i>
				</blockquote>
				In the personal notebook in my possession there is a page upon which is typewritten:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Grand Lodge erased the Ancient charges "to be true to God and the Holy Church" and substituted this charge:
					<blockquote>
						A Mason is obliged by his tenure to obey the Moral Law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid
						Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine.  But though in Ancient Times, Masons were charged in every country to be of the religion
						of that country or nation, moreover it was and yet it is now thought expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which
						all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves; that is to be Good Men and True or Men of Honour and Honesty,
						by whatever Denominations or Persuasions that they may be distinguished whereby Masonry becomes the CENTER OF UNION, and the
						means of conciliating true Friendship among persons that must have remained at a perpetual distance.
					</blockquote>
					 This charge was of unparalleled importance. It founded modern Speculative Freemasonry on the rock of non-sectarianism and the
					 Brotherhood of All Men who believe in a common Father, regardless of His name or the way in which He is worshiped.</i>
				</blockquote>
				In his work, <i>Introduction to Freemasonry</i>, Carl Claudy writes that the Mason:
				<blockquote>
					<i>may name Him as he will, think of Him as he pleases; make Him impersonal law or personal and anthropomorphic; Freemasonry cares
					not ... God, Great Architect of the Universe, Grand Artificer, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge above, Jehovah, Allah, Buddha, Brahma,
					Vishnu, Shiva, or Great Geometer...</i> (Cited by Ankerberg and Weldon, Cult Watch, p. 118).
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly the Masons do not want to identify precisely who God really is so that different
				"<i>persuasions</i>" may freely participate.  That is why they couch His identity in such terms as <i>Great Architect, Grand Artificer, Divine
				Artist</i> and so on.  These terms are all neutral.  The conclusion must be then that, at the very least, Freemasonry thinks of all religions as
				the same and equally valid.  Is that what the Bible teaches?  Is that what Christians believe?  The answer is a resounding <b>"No!"</b> This
				attitude and teaching of the Lodge should be an extreme problem for a Christian.  We know that the Lord God, as revealed by the Bible, whom
				we worship requires that we reverence Him and Him alone.  This is spelled out in both the Old Testament (<b>Exodus 20:1-3</b>) and in the
				New Testament (<b>John 8:23-24; 14:6; Galatians 1:6-9; I Timothy 2:5</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, some Masons claim they have never seen a contradiction between their own practice of
				Christianity and the teachings of the Lodge.  It could be that their Lodge is so dominated by Christians that everything done there reflects
				this and thus they have never personally seen an issue come up.  However, if they have any biblical discernment at all they should be able to
				recognize that what Masons teach here is incompatible with the claims of Christ. And there have certainly been times where it has been made
				an issue.  Jack Harris gives two instances which made him start thinking:
				<blockquote>
					<i>One evening following a meeting, the Chaplain closed his prayers with the phrase, “in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.”  An objection
					was given to this closing.  Usually a universal quotation from the Masonic Manual (blue book) is given at the beginning and end of all
					prayers.  I was shocked by this objection.  I always thought that wherever God is worshipped and reverenced, even in the lodge room, a
					prayer should never exclude His Son, Jesus Christ.  A second indication of deception surfaced the year I was installed as Worshipful
					Master.  By appointment, I visited the Grand Lodge of Maryland and requested a Christian flag be placed next to my chair in the Lodge
					room.  The Grand Master refused on the grounds that such a flag would offend our Jewish, Moslem, and Hindu members.  The incident was
					very upsetting.  My faith in Masonry was fading.</i> (<i>Freemasonry</i>, pp. 12-13.)
				</blockquote>
				Another former Mason, Edmond Ronayne also comments:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Freemasonry "carefully excludes" the Lord Jesus Christ from the Lodge and chapter, repudiates his mediatorship, rejects his atonement,
					denies and disowns his gospel, frowns upon his religion and his church, ignores the Holy Spirit, and sets up for itself a spiritual
					empire, a religious theocracy, at the head of which it places the G.A.O.T.U. -- the god of nature -- and from which the one only
					living and true God is expelled by resolution ...</i> (Cited by Ankerberg and Weldon, <i>Cult Watch</i>, pp. 119-120.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those are strong words indeed but they coincide with the concern I raised earlier in
				the lecture praising geometry.  Harris agrees:
				<blockquote>
				   <i>Masonry’s god is a force in nature, not a personal “Supreme Being.”  If he were a personal god, then he would be named or identified
					in one of the world’s religions, but he is not.</i>” (<i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 78.)
				</blockquote>
				Before we write off these charges as the rantings of two disenchanted former Masons let’s consider a quote from a widely recognized Masonic
				authority, <i>Coil’s Masonic Encyclopedia</i>, which states:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Men have to decide whether they want a God like the ancient Hebrew Jahweh, a partisan tribal god, with whom they can talk and argue and
					from whom they can hide if necessary, or a boundless, eternal, universal, undenominational and international Divine Spirit, so vastly
					removed from the speck called man, that he cannot be known, named or approached. So soon as man begins to laud his God and endow him
					with the most perfect human attributes such as justice, mercy, beneficence, etc., the Divine Essence is depreciated and despoiled ...
					The Masonic test is a Supreme Being, and any qualification added is an innovation and distortion ... Monotheism ... violates Masonic
					principles, for it requires belief in a specific kind of Supreme Deity.</i> (Cited by Ankerberg and Weldon, <i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 115.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ultimately, under the guise of unconditionally accepting all ideas about religion and
				"God", the Masonic Lodge has set up its own god.  This god is an impersonal, naturalistic, overruling force about which one can only
				discover the secrets through a progression through the degrees of Masonry until the true nature of these symbols and rituals is revealed.
				That this is true is shown in later degrees (7th in the York Rite "Royal Arch" and 20th in the Scottish Rite "Master of Symbolic Lodge")
				when it is revealed that Masons know the secret name of God.  It is said to be "Jahbulon" (According to Tsoukalas, pp. 182-3, Albert Pike
				in <i>Book of the Words</i> spells it "Jubelum" or "Jabulum").   There is disagreement between different authorities and sources but what
				seems to be universally agreed on is that the word is a compilation of three words (or names).  Almost all are agreed that "<i>Jah</i>"
				or "<i>Yah</i>" is of Hebrew origin and refers to their God "Jehovah" or "Yahweh".  Most, including Albert Pike who pretty much created
				the Scottish Rite and once again the well respected <i>Coil’s Masonic Encyclopedia</i>, also agree that the "<i>Bul</i>" or "<i>Bel</i>"
				is of Assyrian or Phoenician extract and refers to their chief deities (<i>Bel</i> or <i>Baal</i>).  And "<i>On</i>" is usually seen as
				Egyptian (or in Pike’s case, Hindu) in origin, perhaps representing Osiris (who has a prominent place in Masonic lore as well).  The idea
				behind this Masonic teaching, whatever the particulars of the words/names involved, is that in reality these gods are, in fact, one.
				The Jews, Assyrians, Phoenicians, Egyptians, etc. all worshipped the same "God", they just didn’t realize it.  But now this "truth" has
				been revealed to the Masons.  You can see why they wait until a person is well into his progression before this is taught.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus while the majority of American Masons may say and personally believe that the “G”
				of Freemasonry stands for the biblical God whom Christians worship, they do not understand what is really being perpetuated in the
				teachings of the Lodge.  It is really a progression toward gaining alleged knowledge (lies really) that has been bandied about for
				centuries in the mystery religions of the ancient world.  Again from the website <i>mystae.com</i> I found the following quotation
				from Manly P. Hall in his work <i>Masonic, Hermetic, Quabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy</i>
				<blockquote>
					<i>The ancient Mysteries did not cease to exist when Christianity became the world's most powerful religion. Great Pan did not die!
					Freemasonry is the proof of his survival. The pre-Christian Mysteries simply assumed the symbolism of the new faith, perpetuating
					through its emblems and allegories the same truths which had been the property of the wise since the beginning of the world. There
					is no true explanation, therefore, for Christian symbols save that which is concealed within pagan philosophy. Without the mysterious
					keys carried by the hierophants of the Egyptian, Brahmin, and Persian cults the gates of Wisdom cannot be opened.</i>
				</blockquote>
				Jack Harris asserts,
				<blockquote>
					<i>Why does Freemasonry warn its members to keep the rituals secret?  It is because their rituals do not proceed from God, but instead
					are pagan in nature.  About four hundred high Masons in this country will know exactly what is meant here.  A Mason in a lodge room
					may not realize that the designs, setups, and movements are based on the worship of the sun and generative forces of nature, as
					practiced by the sex cults in ancient times.</i> (<i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 95.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By now it should go without saying that the "G" (and other symbols) Masons so proudly
				display would not be appropriate for a discerning, Bible believing Christian.</font></p>

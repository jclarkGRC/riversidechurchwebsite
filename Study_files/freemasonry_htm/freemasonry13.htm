			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Sharing With and Witnessing to a Mason</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the person you are dealing with is a Mason but not a Christian then the first order of
				business is to witness to them of Jesus and the true nature of salvation which is dependent upon His finished work on the cross and His
				subsequent resurrection from the dead.  It would seem that the biggest obstacle may be overcoming such a person’s ideas about obtaining
				heaven with his good works.  This is not an unusual idea at all even among non-Masons.  Thus I would recommend Ray Comfort’s method of
				evangelism as detailed in <i>The Way of the Master</i> video series.  It gets right to the point that none of us can be good enough to
				enter heaven on our own merit because we have all broken God’s law and continue to do so.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the Mason you are talking to professes to be a Christian the task is to help him see
				that the Lord demands his entire allegiance.  Points to bring up are how a Christian can call those who are believers in other faiths,
				creeds and gods a "brother?"; how faiths which are logically and diametrically opposed to each other can both be "true" and thus
				acceptable;  that Masonry has its own idea and teachings about God and who He is if he will take the time to research and study.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use previously referenced Bible passages to show that the claims of Christ are exclusive
				such as <b>John 8:23-24</b> and <b>14:6</b>; <b>Galatians 1:6-9; I Timothy 2:5</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He may also (as many nominal Christians do) have bought into the idea of good works
				helping him get to heaven.  You need to show him some scriptures about our helplessness to please God through our own goodness like
				<b>Romans 3:23</b> and  <b>4:1-5;  Ephesians 2:8-9</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Help him to see that even though the Masonic Lodge may seek to accomplish good in
				society it is really another religion that many have decided to place their faith in rather than Jesus alone.  Thus a discerning Christian
				should not want to be mixed up in it.  Instead he should serve God through a good Bible believing church.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Is Freemasonry another religion?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the ultimate question for the Bible believing, discerning Christian.  If
				Freemasonry is indeed a religion unto itself, then it is obvious a follower of Christ must not be involved due to the exclusive nature of
				the claims of Jesus and His requirements for His disciples.  If it is not, however, then there is a possibility that a believer <i>could</i>
				be involved though it would mean having to try to ignore a lot of the issues noted above.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we have already mentioned, there is much disagreement about whether or not
				Freemasonry constitutes a religion.  Even among the members of the Lodge themselves there is not a consensus.  On one side are those,
				like Alphonse Cerza (cited by both Steven Tsoukalas and Ankerberg and Weldon), who vehemently deny that Freemasonry is a religion:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The fact that so many clergymen of different denominations can be Masons and find no conflict in carrying on their duties is proof
					enough that Freemasonry is not a religion.</i> (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 17.)
				</blockquote>
				He further lays out four points to make his case:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<i>It does not meet the definition of a religion.
					</li>
					<li>
						It offers no system or teaching of salvation.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has no creed, no confession of faith, no theology, and no ritual of worship.
					</li>
					<li>
						It has no symbols that are religious.</i>
					</li>
				</ol>
				(<i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 100.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thomas Roy, former Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts wrote:
				<blockquote>
					<i>We have none of the marks of religion.  We have no creed, and no confession of faith in a doctrinal statement.  We have no theology.
					We have no ritual of worship.  We have no symbols that are religious in the sense of the symbols found in church and synagogue. ...
					Our purpose is not that of a religion.  We are not primarily interested in the redemption of man.  We seek no converts.  We solicit no
					new members.  We raise no money for religious purposes .... </i>” (Cited by Tsoukalas in <i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 19.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are several others who have written much the same.  The main contention of this
				group of Masons (likely a large majority) would be that it is a fraternal organization, pure and simple, which only desires to have a
				positive effect and influence on society in general and also in the lives of the individual men who join.  An important question might
				be, "<i>Isn’t that enough?</i>"  If a group denies being a religion does that settle the matter? Shouldn’t they themselves have the right
				to define who and what they are without having to defend that definition?  Tsoukalas makes a good reply to this question:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Whether Freemasonry is a religion depends not on what Masons consciously believe, but on what Masonic ritual actually means.  The proof
					lies in the ritual itself, concerning which -- remember -- most Masons are uninformed.</i> (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, pp. 18-19.)
				</blockquote>
				So a better question might be: "<i>You claim none of these elements are in your organization -- but is that true?</i>"</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That this reply is appropriate becomes clear when one discovers that not all Lodge
				members and noted authorities agree that Freemasonry is not a religion.  Some try to take a middle-of-the-road, straddle-the-fence approach
				by continuing to deny that the Craft is a religion but admitting that it is "<i>religious in character</i>". (Grand Lodge of Massachusetts
				cited by Tsoukalas, <i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, pp. 17-18.)  However, some  have no trouble declaring that Freemasonry is a religion.
				At least two respected authorities have gone on record in making this assertion.  Henry Wilson Coil who authored <i>Coil’s Masonic
				Encyclopedia</i> writes:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The fact that Freemasonry is a mild religion does not mean that it is no religion.</i> (<i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 103.)
				</blockquote>
				Ankerberg and Weldon also refer to Mackey’s <i>Revised Encyclopedia of Freemasonry</i> in which Albert Mackey first gives a definition of
				religion and then comments:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Freemasonry may rightfully claim to be called a religious institution</i>." (<i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 101.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To decide for ourselves about this we must have a reasonable definition of what
				constitutes a "religion".  Tsoukalas borrows nine elements from the <i>Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i>, whose author, William P. Alston,
				says "<i>when enough of these characteristics are present to a sufficient degree we have a religion</i>".  They are the following:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Belief in supernatural beings (God or gods).
					</li>
					<li>
						A distinction between sacred and profane objects.
					</li>
					<li>
						Ritual acts focused on sacred objects.
					</li>
					<li>
						A moral code believed to be sanctioned by God (or gods).
					</li>
					<li>
						Characteristically religious feelings (awe, sense of mystery, sense of guilt, adoration), which tend to be aroused in the presence
						of sacred objects and during the practice of ritual, and which are connected in idea with God (or gods).
					</li>
					<li>
						Prayer and/or other forms of communication with God (or gods).
					</li>
					<li>
						A world view, or a general picture of the world as a whole and the place of the individual therein.  This picture contains some
						specification of an overall purpose or point of the world and an indication of how the individual fits into it.
					</li>
					<li>
						A more or less total organization of one’s life based on the world view.
					</li>
					<li>
						A social group bound together by the above.
					</li>
				</ol>
				(<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, pp. 24-25.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us review what we have found thus far to see if Freemasonry meets the above criteria.
				Does the Lodge believe in a supernatural being?  Obviously, yes, who is referred to as the G.A.O.T.U.  Coil comments:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Freemasonry certainly requires a belief in the existence of, and man’s dependence upon, a Supreme Being to whom he is responsible.
					What can a church add to that, except to bring into one fellowship those who have like feelings? ... That is exactly what the Lodge
					does.</i>  (cited in <i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 101.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are there objects which the Craft recognizes as <i>sacred</i> and others seen as
				<i>profane</i>. Again, yes.  We see them meeting in a <i>temple</i>, kneeling at an <i>altar</i>, upon which rests the <i>Volume of Sacred
				Law</i>.  As he is accepted at various stages, an initiate is presented with a <i>Lambskin Apron</i> and instructed in the meaning of the
				letter "<i>G</i>". Things that are "profane" could include the <i>hoodwink</i> which represents the candidate’s previous "darkness" before
				becoming a Mason.  Tsoukalas comments that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Rough Ashlar and the Perfect Ashlar are two examples. "By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by
					nature; by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive, by a virtuous education, our own endeavors,
					and the blessing of God."</i> (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 27.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are there ritual activities focused on sacred objects?  Yes.  One example is that as an
				initiate places his hands on the objects on the altar he makes sacred vows regarding his duties and responsibilities regarding his new
				station in the Lodge.  Afterward he kisses the VSL.  Next, is there a moral code sanctioned by God?  It seems the main point of Freemasonry
				is that each member build and erect his "temple" (life) in a manner which would please God.  The personal notebook of the former Mason I
				have alluded to previously quotes the September, 1932 issue of <i>New Age</i> magazine which says:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The candidate seeking Masonic Light voluntarily makes a contract with the Fraternity -- a contract the provisions of which Masonry
					fully expects him to fulfill honorably and ever observe. There are rules by which to be guided, regulations to be obeyed, vows to be
					remembered and put into daily practice!</i>
				</blockquote>
				On the bottom of same page the following note is typed:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Whatever he believes to be the revealed will of the Grand Architect constitutes for him the spiritual trestle board -- the rule and
					guide of his conduct.</i>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is there the presence of religious feelings (awe, guilt, etc.) during the practice of
				ritual in a Masonic temple?  This is subjective, of course, because no one can speak with certainty about the inner feelings of anyone
				else.  But certainly it can be seen that the ritual, in the way it is conducted and by its various activities, is intended to communicate
				a somberness, a serious need for contemplation, a sense of mystery and so forth.  For example, the blindfolding, the oaths, the emphasis
				on secrecy, the encouragement to proceed further in "Masonic light", and many other elements, all seem calculated to contribute to inducing
				such feelings.  One of those other elements is the next characteristic of religion which is prayer.  This is a prevalent feature of Lodge
				meetings. Albert Mackey writes:
				<blockquote>
					<i>We open and close our Lodges with prayer; we invoke the blessing of the Most High upon all our labors; we demand of our neophytes a
					profession of trusting belief in the existence and superintending care of God; and we teach them to bow with humility and reverence at
					his sacred name. </i>(<i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 108.)
				</blockquote>
				The next two elements of religion, a particular world view and the arranging of one’s life according to it based on the teachings of the
				religion is easily seen in Freemasonry.  Their adherence to a moral code approved by the Great Architect is a major part of that.  Tsoukalas
				points to and quotes their teaching about the Trestle-Board:
				<blockquote>
					<i>By the Trestle-Board, we are reminded, that as the operative workman erects his temporal building agreeably to the rules and designs
					laid down by the Master of the Trestle-Board, so should we, both Operative and Speculative, endeavor to erect our spiritual building
					agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe in the Book of Life, which is our Spiritual
					Trestle-Board.</i>  (cited in <i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p.36.)
				</blockquote>
				Another big factor of this element has to do with the hoped for end result of all their activity, namely, to be able to enter the Grand
				Lodge Above at death.  You will remember that some Masonic authorities claimed to not be a religion partly because they offered no plan
				of salvation and were not mainly interested in the redemption of man.  I would probably agree that most of the Lodge’s focus and activity
				is likely directed to the here and now in doing good, etc.  However, there is certainly some degree of attention given to the hereafter.
				Ankerberg and Weldon quote <i>Coil’s Masonic Encyclopedia</i> which asserts:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Freemasonry has a religious service to commit the body of a deceased brother to the dust whence it came, and to speed the liberated
					spirit back to the Great Source of Light.  Many Freemasons make this flight with no other guarantee of a safe landing than their
					belief in the religion of Freemasonry.</i> (cited by <i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 102.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alston’s ninth and final aspect of religion -- a social group bound by the previous
				eight characteristics -- is self-evident in the existence of the Lodge itself.  So it is that we see that Freemasonry is clearly a
				religion based on a reasonable definition  and the verifiable presence of those elements in the Lodge.  Tsoukalas also gives information,
				elements and comparison of Freemasonry to some of the mystery religions prevalent in ancient Babylon, Egypt, India, etc.  We will not
				explore these but simply mention that some of the things they have in common include the great use of symbolism, a system of gnosis
				(secret knowledge), and a great drama (e.g., legends of Hiram and Osiris), among others (cf. Steven Tsoukalas, <i>Masonic Rites and
				Wrongs</i>, pp. 84-90).  We will conclude this section with one last quote from Henry Wilson Coil and a final thought:
				<blockquote>
					<i>That brings us to the real crux of the matter.  The difference between a Lodge and a church is one of degree and not of kind.  Some
					think because it [the Lodge] is not a strong or highly formalized or highly dogmatized religion, such as the Roman Catholic Church ...
					it can be no religion at all.  But a church of friends (Quakers) exhibits even less formality and ritual than does a Masonic Lodge. ...
					The fact that Freemasonry is a mild religion does not mean that it is no religion.</i> (cited in <i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 103.)
				</blockquote>
				If it is a religion, then a true Christian has no business being involved in it.</font></p>

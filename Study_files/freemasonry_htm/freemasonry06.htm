			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Blue Lodge</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The three foundational degrees of the Masonic Lodge are usually referred to as the <i>Blue
				Lodge</i>.  The first question that comes to mind inquires about their reasons for choosing <b>Blue</b> as the name instead of some other
				color.  According to a personal set of notes from a former Mason, the explanation comes from <b>Ezekiel 1:26</b> where Ezekiel, in his
				vision, reports that the throne of God was "<i>in appearance like a sapphire stone</i>".  Since the general perception is that sapphires
				are blue (though I understand they can be other colors as well), this color was chosen.  The notes further assert that "<i>Blue denoted
				the glory of God</i>.”  This statement is subject to debate; however, it seems clear that the intention Freemasons had was to honor the
				Lord by calling the first three degrees by the name <b>Blue</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, that’s not all there is to it.  Obviously, this is not a critical matter but
			I want to demonstrate my earlier contention that along with a recognition of God through biblical references like this, there are mixed in
			other factoids and references that somewhat neutralize the intention.  On the very next page is more information about sapphires which would
			speak to the superstitious and pagan at heart.  Consider the following excerpt:
			<blockquote>
				<i>Sapphires have always been considered lucky stones, but in India the natives consider the star sapphire the most powerful of all.  Not
				only does it bring health, wealth, and happiness and ward off poverty, sickness and sorrow, but it is also a charm against devils.  The
				poorest native makes it the main object of his life to acquire a star sapphire, for through it he firmly believes all other good fortune
				will come.  More than any other stone it would seem to have true mystic qualities,...</i>
			</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What’s the point here?  Did the owner of these notes or any of his fellow Lodge members
				really believe this information?  Or was it just an interesting sidelight?  Who can know?  But before we completely dismiss the potential
				influence such teaching might have, let’s think about how many people read their horoscope daily for guidance or believe in other types of
				lucky superstitions?  The issue here is that when we begin to attribute God’s protection and blessing to earthly, 'magical' objects,
				we take away from His glory and also from our dependence upon Him alone.  That practice or attitude is certainly not Christian or
				biblical.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now to perhaps more pertinent issues.  What are the three foundational degrees all
				about?  We have already seen the official titles that a man assumes when he completes the work to obtain the degrees, but to remind us
				they are:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Entered Apprentice
					</li>
					<li>
						Fellow Craft
					</li>
					<li>
						Master Mason
					</li>
				</ol>
				The first point is that everyone who becomes a Mason <b>must</b> begin with the Blue Lodge.  That may seem self-evident (even redundant)
				but after the Blue Lodge there are at least two options for continuing one’s progression in Freemasonry which are quite divergent and
				also lead to other separate organizations and activities.  According to John Ankerberg and John Weldon, there are differing attitudes
				about these first three degrees:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Most Masons believe that Blue Lodge Masonry makes one as full or complete a Mason as one can (or needs to) be.  But an important fact
					must be noted.  While the Blue Lodge is Masonry, and while it is the Masonry of most Masons, it is not all that Masonry constitutes.
					Some Masons would view Blue Lodge Masonry as it is usually interpreted as an initial or beginning form of Masonry, and maintain that
					the real substance of Masonry -- its lifeblood -- lies in the higher degrees and in the initiate’s search for their true meaning.
					Some Masons would even consider Blue Lodge Masonry as only the <b>cover</b> of the book, but not the book itself.  These Masons would
					say that to truly understand Masonry one must open the book and read what lies <b>within</b> the cover.  What one finds there will
					shock even many Masons.</i>  (<i>Cult Watch</i>, pp. 93-94; emphasis theirs).
				</blockquote>
				The point to note is that if you ever meet a self-proclaimed Master Mason you can be confident that he at least has gone through the
				learning, work and the ritual for these first three degrees.  They are common to all Freemasons.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now let’s examine the process of becoming a Blue Lodge Mason.  To begin we’ll consider
				how a person becomes introduced and involved with Freemasonry in the first place.  While acknowledging that there may be those with
				personal experiences not in line with this, in theory the Masonic Lodge does not overtly recruit and seek suitable members for their
				organization.  To become involved with the Lodge, a man must inquire or request to be admitted of his own volition.   Now, the reality
				is that there is likely a great deal of covert recruitment.  Jack Harris gives this testimony:
				<blockquote>
					<i>In 1961, ... I was approached very subtly and asked, "What do you think about Freemasonry?" ... I was then indirectly asked to
					consider joining the Freemasons.</i> (<i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 11.)
				</blockquote>
				Obviously, if a man has been surreptitiously sought out by a member of the Lodge, his worthiness and willingness concerning the Lodge
				has no doubt already been assessed.  But if a mistake has been made and the potential candidate shows no interest then he is not pursued
				further.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a man inquires (or has been enticed to do so), he is then evaluated as to his
				fitness for the Lodge.  Harris continues:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Three Lodge members visited me to investigate my character.  A friendly conversation evolved, including the following questions: "Were
					you ever convicted of a crime?"  "What church do you attend?"  "What are your interests?"  "Are you married or divorced?"  The vote
					and acceptance for my initiation into the first three degrees of Freemasonry occurred in May 1961.</i>  ( Ibid., p. 12.)
				</blockquote>
				We have already noted that only  male adults, freeborn and unmutilated (physically unimpaired) are permitted to join.  However, there
				are certainly other matters that Lodge members ask about.  We will note here that once a man is fully qualified as a Master Mason he is
				able to visit other Blue Lodges besides his own.  Likewise, if he is suspended or expelled from his own Lodge, he is also disconnected
				from all others. (<i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 98)</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Back to: <a href="freemasonry08.htm">The First Degree -- <i>Entered Apprentice</i> -- Symbolism</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="freemasonry10.htm">The Second Degree -- <i>Fellow Craft</i> (continued)</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Second Degree -- <i>Fellow Craft</i></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we turn to the next degree of the Blue Lodge.  We will not go through the entire
				ritual in detail this time.  Suffice it to say that the candidate for the <i>Fellow Craft</i> degree again dresses in the same or similar
				clothes as the first degree and enters the main lodge room.  Once there he is tested with a series of questions whose answers he is to have
				memorized.  He is once again led around the room, is given more teaching, learns the passwords, grips and signs for the second degree and
				takes more oaths.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems the biggest emphasis of the <i>Fellow Craft</i> degree is to encourage the new
				initiate to earnestly delve into the fields of science and nature or, in other words, the liberal arts.  One web site, www.mystae.com,
				gives examples of questions the initiate is asked, among which is, "<i>What are the peculiar objects of research in this degree?</i>"
				The answer he is required to give is: "<i>The hidden mysteries of nature and science.</i>"  The same site further asserts that "<i>On
				completion of the making of the new Fellow Craft he is told: 'You are now expected to make the liberal arts and sciences your future
				study.</i>'"  and also that "<i>The Second or 'Fellowcraft' Degree of Freemasonry gives very little knowledge to the candidate but it does
				introduce the idea of  'hidden mysteries of nature and science' and makes a clear reference to what is called the 'Galilean
				Heresy.</i>'"</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will now look at some of the legends and symbols introduced in the second degree.  In
				the personal notebook one of the "<i>two most beautiful symbols and legends of Masonry</i>" is the "<i>Legend of the Winding Stair</i>".
				In the ritual, the senior deacon conducts the candidate on an "<i>imaginary flight of winding stairs consisting of three, five and seven
				steps to a place representing the middle chamber of King Solomon’s temple.</i>" (Harris, <i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 84.)  They begin at a point
				just in front and between the two pillars and then take three steps through and beyond the columns at which point the initiate is instructed
				on the significance of the number of these steps.  Then five and the teaching and likewise seven and then the final destination.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The overall picture is the continuing journey of the Mason into the mysteries of the
				Lodge and, from that knowledge, the ordering of his life to be more pleasing to both the Supreme Architect and his fellow men.  He is
				passing from "<i>childhood and youth to the serious tasks of manhood</i>"  (excerpt from personal notebook of former Mason).  He starts
				at the pillars because they represent the <i>strength</i> he will need <i>to establish</i> his new approach to life.  The <i>three</i>
				steps refer to the first three degrees of Freemasonry and also to the three principal officers of the Lodge which are the Worshipful
				Master, the Senior Warden and the Junior Warden (Harris, p. 85).  The five steps point to the five orders of architecture (Tuscan, Doric,
				Ionic, Corinthian and Composite) and also the five senses (hearing, seeing, feeling, smelling and tasting). In each of these two groups of
				five, <u>three</u> of the components are preferred.  In architecture the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian, being of Greek origin and innovative
				are preferred over the other two because they are Roman copycat styles.  Of the senses hearing, seeing and feeling are preferred because
				"<i>by hearing we hear the word; by seeing we perceive the sign; and by feeling we receive the grip, whereby we may know one brother from
				another, in the dark as well as the light.</i>"  (Ibid., p. 86).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The seven steps point to the seven branches of the liberal arts and sciences which are:
				Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music and Astronomy.  Of these seven the  "<i><u>fifth</u>, Geometry, is most revered by
				Masons</i>" (Ibid., p. 87 -- underline mine).  He ends up in the <i>middle</i> chamber of Solomon’s temple because this is the second or
				middle degree of the three in the Blue Lodge.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nothing in the legend or ritual itself seems to be anti-Christian.  However there is
				perhaps some concern over the apparent use of numerology. You probably noticed the underlined words which point to a progression from
				three to five to seven.  In the personal notebook a page has as the heading <i>Introduction to Meaning of Sacred Numbers</i> with a
				question immediately underneath "<i>Why 3, 5, 7?</i>"  It goes on to note <i>3 Patriarchs, 5 Books of Moses, 7 Days of the Week</i>
				as, apparently, other reasons these  numbers are special.  There are many other pages in the notebook which talk about various numbers
				and how they are significant and why and so on. While Christians recognize that some numbers in the Bible show up too regularly for it
				to be a mere coincidence (the numbers seven, ten, twelve, and forty come readily to mind) most do not spend an inordinate amount of time
				trying to figure out why God chose to use those numbers the way He did.  Why not?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For one thing, doing so leads one down a path of trying to figure out some sort of
				secret knowledge or code that is hidden in the numbers or between the lines.  This author believes that many well-meaning souls have
				been sidetracked and deluded by such a search.  I would submit that God has made very plain what He wants people to know about Himself,
				the nature of reality and our responsibilities. Looking for further "secret" knowledge is simply a distraction from putting into practice
				what we already know.  It also fosters that sense of superiority which one can assume by believing he or she is seeking the "deeper"
				mysteries about God while others are not doing so.  Here again is felt the taint of Gnosticism with respect to Freemasonry.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second concern about this ritual and its numerology is one I have expressed before,
				namely, the free intermingling of elements of biblical Christianity with paganism or mythology.  In many heathen religions is also a
				fascination with certain numbers and how to tap into their power.  Immediately under the last referenced excerpt from the personal notebook
				about the patriarchs, books of Moses and days of the week is this line: “<i>Under Libra the seventh sign of the Zodiac, day and night,
				light and darkness are evenly and perfectly balanced; seven for this reason was considered the perfect number</i>".  Do I believe that
				most Masonic Lodge members take astrology seriously?  I would say probably not, at least here in the United States.  Nevertheless, it
				is troubling to see that such pagan and superstitious factoids are presented with equal weight with all the other elements (including
				biblical references) of their teaching.  Once again, this is not an isolated occurrence but prevalent throughout.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another major part of the instruction in the second degree of the Blue Lodge has to do
				with the revelation of the symbolism of the letter "G".  This letter in capital form is prominently displayed in the heart of the main
				Masonic symbol beneath a compass and above a square whose legs overlap each other.  It is commonly known that the letter is used to
				represent two main objects.  The first is <i>geometry</i> which recalls to us the legend of the <i>Winding Stair</i> and the seven liberal
				arts and sciences of which the fifth, geometry, is chief.  Why is it considered so important?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Steven Tsoukalas cites a Masonic Grand Lodge textbook to reveal that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>By Geometry we may curiously trace Nature through her various windings to her most concealed recesses.  By it we discover the power,
					wisdom and goodness of the Grand Artificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions of the vast machine.  By it we
					discover how the planets move in their respective orbit, and demonstrate their various revolutions.  By it we account for the return
					of seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays to the discerning eye.  Numberless worlds are all around us, all
					framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the vast expanse, and we are all conducted by the same unerring law of
					Nature.</i>  (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 69.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having had some higher mathematics in school I can certainly understand having
				appreciation and respect for the subject.  There is no doubt that discovering such principles helps us to understand some of the
				orderly aspects of creation.  The order and laws are there to be found because the Lord used them in His creative work.  However,
				the lofty claims of the Masons about geometry appear a bit overreaching to me.  To say that through the application of geometry we can
				pierce the deepest mysteries of the universe and "<i>discover</i>" and "<i>account</i>"  for all these marvels seems somewhat presumptuous.
				Given that there are aspects of the universe (e.g., black holes) that seem to defy the conventional laws of physics that we (mankind)
				think we understand, I believe it’s safe to say that we probably won’t solve the mysteries of the universe with geometry alone ... if
				at all.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To be fair, we must remember that many of these ritual formulas and speeches were
				written decades before many modern space age discoveries were made. <b>Note:</b> This concession does call into question the relevancy
				of the ancient wisdom/knowledge that Freemasonry claims to be able to impart to its adherents, e.g.:
				<blockquote>
					<i>In Plato's Timaeus, there appears the earliest known equation of the Creator with the 'Architect of the Universe'. The Creator, in
					the Timaeus, is called 'tekton', meaning 'craftsman' or 'builder'. 'Arche-tekton' thus denoted 'master craftsman' or 'master builder'.
					For Plato, the 'arche-tekton' crafted the cosmos by means of geometry.</i> (Baigent and Leigh, <i>The Temple and the Lodge</i> cited on
					mystae.com).
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only thing in the quotation regarding Geometry that bothers me as a Christian is
				the emphasis on "<i>Nature</i>".  It seems to parrot secular ideas with regard to nature being almost an entity unto itself (or, to some,
				"herself").  Which brings us to the next idea brought to you today by the letter "G".  (My apologies to Sesame Street.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter "G" also refers to the <i>Great Architect of the Universe</i>.  During the
				second degree lecture the Worshipful Master continues:
				<blockquote>
					<i>But my Brother (or Brethren), the letter G has a still further and most solemn allusion.  It alludes to the sacred name of God, to
					whom should we all, from the youthful Entered Apprentice who stands in the north-east corner of the Lodge to the Worshipful Master
					who presides in the East, most humbly and reverently bow.</i>  (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 69.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No problem with the words themselves -- we would certainly agree that all will bow
				before and acknowledge the Lord’s authority and worthiness.  And no problem with the use of "G" to refer to a recognition of God -- just
				as there is no issue with the use of a cross or the fish symbol or a lapel pin or other such thing to show our devotion to Christ.  The
				question that often comes to mind, however, when I see such an item on someone I don’t know very well is: "<i>What does that symbol really
				mean to you?</i>”  For example, when I see celebrities wearing a cross, whose lives are obviously out of control or who are practicing
				overt immorality, I have to question their basic understanding of God, Jesus, the Bible and Christianity <i>or</i> I wonder if they attach
				some other meaning to the symbol entirely.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same applies here. When Freemasonry claims that "G" is for God and having seen what
				we’ve studied, I am forced to consider what they might mean when they speak of "God".  As we go forward I think we will find the God of
				the Lodge is <b>not</b> the same God Christians worship.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Why the image of "masonry"?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It will become quite clear as we continue to explore Freemasonry that it uses a plethora
				of symbols in its Ritual and teachings.  The question for the moment is why was the theme of masonry, the craft of building structures,
				adopted as the central symbolic emphasis of the organization?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already seen there is an alleged early association with literal Masonic guilds.
				However, those unproven legends would not be remembered nor perpetuated by the Lodge if the images of the craft of masonry, its related
				tools, etc., was not pleasing and useful for their purposes -- which they are.  But how?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The answer is not difficult to discover or understand, especially for Christians who are
				familiar with the image used by Peter of individual Christians being "<i>living stones</i>" which God uses to build "<i>up a spiritual
				house</i>" (<b>I Peter 2:5</b>).  To members of the Lodge the main purpose of participation is to <i>build</i> their own lives in such a
				way as to be pleasing to the <i>Great Architect of the Universe</i> (aka G.A.O.T.U.; the main way members refer to God).  Necessarily
				associated with this endeavor is the construction (or reconstruction) of one’s life in such a way that the member will be responsible,
				productive, virtuous, benevolent, reverent, etc.  or, in general, a moral and upstanding man and outstanding citizen who does what he
				ought in order to do right by his family and friends and neighbors.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For an example of this I submit an article which was pasted in the personal notes
				of a former Lodge member which asked how a Mason may know whether or not he is being benefited by his membership.  To determine the
				answer the article posed eleven questions for the Mason to answer.  Among them are the following:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>1. Has Masonry given you sympathy with all good causes, and made you eager to espouse them</i>?
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>2. Has it made you public-spirited</i>?
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>3. Has its great teachings of brotherhood made you a brother to the weak</i>?
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>5. Has it taught you to turn deaf ears to the jingle of tainted money, the rustle of an unholy skirt?</i>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>7. Have Masonic ideals taught you to be high minded and happy in the meaner drudgeries of life?</i>
					</li>
				</ul>
				Freemasonry obviously gives much emphasis to personal development in morality. Thus it is easy to see the relation between what literal
				masons do in constructing real buildings and what the Masonic Lodge seeks to do by encouraging the membership to build their own lives
				("temples") in a proper and pleasing way. Former Worshipful Master Jack Harris writes, "<i>Masonry is indeed in the business of building
				spiritual temples in the hearts of initiates</i>." (<i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 19.)</font></p>

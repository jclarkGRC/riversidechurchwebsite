			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Third Degree -- Master Mason</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last degree of the Blue Lodge is called the <i>Master Mason</i>.  In the introduction
				to this section we noted that many in the organization feel that obtaining this level makes one as complete a Mason as one ever needs to
				be.  Steven Tsoukalas comments:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The third degree of Blue Lodge Masonry ... is considered the pinnacle of Freemasonry.  Though there are higher numbered degrees in,
					for example, the York Rite and the Scottish Rite, from a strictly Blue Lodge perspective these are best seen as concentric circles
					extending outward from the pinnacle.</i> (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 71.)
				</blockquote>
				It is very likely that those who are seeking the higher degrees and "deeper" knowledge might disagree with those sentiments and see these
				primary degrees as only the first stepping stones to true enlightenment.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, the third degree does complete the Blue Lodge cycle.  One aspect of this
				that we have not seen before is how, to the Mason, this progression through the three degrees symbolizes a typical journey through life.
				Again, Tsoukalas summarizes it well:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Entered Apprentice degree represents youth in time of learning; the Fellow Craft, manhood in time of work; and the Master Mason,
					old age in wisdom and the culmination of life leading to death. </i>(Ibid.)
				</blockquote>
				So it is that the third degree gives great  emphasis to what becomes of a man at the time of his death.  But there is also a considerable
				amount of other information dispensed -- more than in the second degree.  Several objects and symbols are either introduced or more fully
				explained as to their meanings (e.g., the All-Seeing Eye, the Pot of Incense, the Forty-seventh Problem of Euclid, the Anchor and the Ark,
				the Scythe).  This study will not spend time exploring such things but will instead concentrate on, most would probably agree, the single
				most important element of the third degree and perhaps of the entire Blue Lodge.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In looking at the second degree we saw the first of, according to the personal notebook
				in my possession, the "<i>two most beautiful symbols and legends of Masonry</i>" which was the <i>Legend of the Winding Stair</i>.  Now we
				will see the second, namely, the <i>Legend of Hiram Abif</i> (some spell the last name <i>Abiff</i>) also known as the <i>Legend of the Third
				Degree</i>. To demonstrate how pivotal this teaching is we note that it is often included in the <i>Landmarks</i> of a recognized Masonic
				authority or a given Lodge.
				<blockquote>
					<b>Note:</b> <i>Landmarks</i> are simply laws of Freemasonry which are generally acknowledged to be true and not to be changed else
					the Masonic institution would "<i>lose its identity and cease to be Masonry</i>" (Personal notebook of former Mason).
				</blockquote>
				However, these supposed immutable laws seem to be undermined a bit by the fact that different Lodges and authorities often have different
				sets of Landmarks.  Most sets do seem to have laws and themes in common with the main differences owing to either a desire to boil the list
				down to essentials or a wish to include more detail and nuance in the list.  For instance, the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts has as Landmarks
				a list of only seven laws (with the legend of the Third Degree being the fourth) while Albert Mackey lists twenty-five (with the legend
				being number three).  The rest of the list of seven seems to be numbers 18-21 and 23-24 in Mackey’s list, though not in the same order.
				In any event, the inclusion of the Hiramic legend in various sets of Landmarks speaks to its importance to Freemasonry.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is the Legend and how is it presented in the initiation to the Master Mason degree?
				Much of the beginning is similar to the first two degrees -- after some questioning, the candidate is blindfolded, led in with a cable-tow,
				ceremonially "threatened" with the consequences of revealing the secrets he is about to learn, and led to take the same sort of oaths as
				before.  The ceremony is completed and a prayer is offered.  Then the members listen as the Worshipful Master recounts the story of Master
				Hiram Abif.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, a little background.  The main character’s name is alleged to be found in the Bible,
				specifically <b>I Kings 7:13-14, 40, 45b</b> (cf. parallel passage <b>II Chronicles 4:11-16</b>).  Hiram (or Huram -- not to be confused
				with Hiram, king of Tyre who was also dealing with Solomon during this period) was a master craftsman who specialized in metalwork and
				oversaw the making of the bronze ornaments and tools of the Temple.  From this brief and somewhat sketchy information about the real man,
				the Masons weave an interesting tale going well beyond the scope of the biblical revelation.  Whether Masons truly believe the Legend as
				a tradition passed down or simply view it as an allegorical myth based on a nugget of truth is a matter of conjecture.  It is likely that
				among the membership you would find some in both camps.  Again we must note that there will be variations of both the telling of the Legend
				and the lessons inferred from it by the instructor according to the Lodge in which it is presented.  Here we will try to give the common
				themes.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Apparently between King Solomon, Hiram king of Tyre and Hiram the master craftsman was
				shared the knowledge of a secret word which was in reality the true name of God (the <i>ineffable name</i> -- though this specific fact
				is not revealed until later degrees are obtained as we saw previously).  The word could not be spoken unless all three of them were in one
				place together.  Three of Hiram’s assistants accosted him demanding that he share his secret.  When he refused they killed him (some
				versions suggest they approached him separately and the third killed him but all were culpable).  He was hidden by the assailants amidst
				the debris of the temple and then later moved and buried.  His grave was marked with a sprig of acacia which, though broken off,
				subsequently budded and bloomed.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before the three murderers could escape, the other <i>Fellowcrafters</i> involved in the
				construction of the temple noticed Hiram was missing and set out to find him.  They discovered him because of the acacia and then captured
				the three murderers who confessed and were punished by death.  The body of Hiram was recovered and they tried to raise him through means
				of the “grips” (secret handshakes) of the first and second degrees.  These attempts failed.  King Solomon himself then attempted to raise
				Hiram "<i>by the strong grip of a Master Mason, or the Lion’s Paw of the Tribe of Judah.</i>" (<i>Official Cipher</i>, Grand Lodge of
				Massachusetts, p. 164 cited by Tsoukalas, <i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 76.)  Apparently this ultimately fails, too, because the
				legend concludes by saying that Hiram, after being hidden first in the rubbish of the temple construction, and then quickly and secretly
				buried out on a hillside, now finally receives a decent and proper interment near Solomon’s temple.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What must be understood is that as the Worshipful Master is relating the tale various
				members of the Lodge are reenacting the legend in dramatic fashion.  The candidate himself is Hiram the craftsman.  The Worshipful Master
				becomes Solomon.  Others (usually officers) play the roles of the three ruffian assistants and the two Fellowcrafters who try to raise
				Hiram’s body with the grips of the first and second degree.  So the candidate is (theatrically) accosted, threatened, murdered, hidden,
				buried and raised by the various characters he encounters as the legend is unfolded.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The highlight of the ritual is when the Worshipful Master, as Solomon, using the grip
				of a Master Mason raises the candidate to the <i>five points of fellowship</i>.  In other words they stand "<i>foot to foot, knee to knee,
				breast to breast, hand to back, and cheek to cheek or mouth to ear.</i>" (Jack Harris, <i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 91.)  It sounds to me like
				a formal hug.  As the Worshipful Master does this he whispers a word into the ear of the candidate.  Since in the legend Hiram was not
				successfully raised the secret word could not be repeated because the three "Masters" were not now together.  The word in effect became
				lost as the other two Masters eventually died (much of the Scottish Rite is concerned with the search for the lost word).  However,
				Solomon substituted another word which is now revealed to the initiate -- "<i>Mah-Hah-Bone</i>".  Nobody is sure what it means though
				some think it is derived from Hebrew and refers to a building or a builder.  The word must not be repeated unless one is in the "five
				points of fellowship" position.  (That condition would no doubt keep me from overusing it.)  Thus a big secret is passed on to the new
				Master Mason.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are several other elements related to the ritual with associated teachings. For
				example, the number three is prominent as there are three Grand Masters in possession of the secret word; three assassins with three
				different weapons which they used to attack Hiram; there are three gates where the ruffians met Hiram and through which he tried to escape;
				and then three burial places for Hiram’s body.  Each of these elements is used to teach a moral lesson or to try to give the hearers
				something to think about.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the overriding and overwhelming major lesson of the <i>Legend of Hiram Abif</i>
				(along with all the other symbols and teachings of the third degree) is the immortality of the soul and the hope of a glorious afterlife
				in the Grand Lodge above with the Great Architect of the Universe.  Remember, this third degree points to that third stage of life in
				which old age followed by death becomes a prominent reality.  Nevertheless, though death will eventually overtake each Mason’s body, his
				soul, like the acacia sprig, may yet bud and bloom in an eternal springtime.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are a couple of concerns with this ritual that I will point out.  Neither is new
				but both are worth reiterating. First, many sources (from both Masonic apologists and its critics) point to a close similarity between
				the <i>Legend of Hiram Abif</i> and the ancient Egyptian myth of the god Osiris.  Osiris was also ambushed by a rival, murdered, disposed
				of, found (by his wife Isis), and eventually triumphs by becoming the ruler of the underworld.  I will not belabor the point but once
				again we see a free intermingling or overlapping of the teachings of Freemasonry with paganism.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second concern relates to this teaching of a hope or the promise of a glorious
				afterlife for the Mason.  There are two parts to the concern.  First, as we have already asked, "<i>Upon what basis do Masons expect to be
				rewarded with such an existence after death?</i>"  We saw before from their own words that it is a hope based on being able to live well
				enough that the G.A.O.T.U. would accept them into his realm.  Steven Tsoukalas cites the <i>Murrow Masonic Monitor</i> from the Grand Lodge
				of Oklahoma:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Remember, then, that as the body of G.M.H.A. [Grand Master Hiram Abif] was buried in the rubbish of the Temple, so must yours be buried
					in earth’s friendly bosom; as he was raised, so likewise must you be raised -- not indeed, by the brotherly grip of an earthly master,
					but at the awful command of Him who rules the heaven and the earth, ... <b>Let the Temple, which you have this evening partly raised, be
					so beautiful, so adorned with Charity’s choicest jewels, and so acceptable to the All-Seeing Eye, that when, at the close of a virtuous
					life, you are summoned hence by the Omnific Word, you may be admitted to that glorious and celestial Temple</b>, that house not made
					with hands, eternal in the heavens.</i> (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 79 -- emphasis mine.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The "<i>Temple ... partly raised</i>" is a reference to the new life Masons are being
				motivated to build through the teachings of the Craft.  Thus, to be admitted to that "<i>glorious and celestial Temple</i>" this new life
				must be "<i>beautiful ... adorned with Charity ... acceptable ... virtuous</i>".  It is obviously a performance based system of ultimate
				salvation.  We have already pointed out that this is contrary to the biblical teachings regarding salvation
				(cf. <b>Ephesians 2:8-9</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second part of this concern about their teachings with respect to a glorious afterlife
				is that the Lodge holds that such salvation is equally available to all Masons regardless of what religion they observe or what god they
				worship.  As we have seen, they consider this possible because, to them, all gods are merely different expressions of that one true
				universal spirit or "<i>Father</i>" over all.  Further it is possible for anyone to act in a moral or virtuous manner no matter what
				religion he chooses to observe.  Good works are universal and quantifiable.  But, again, we have already seen that the Bible teaches
				that the only way to approach and worship God in truth is through Christ Himself (cf. <b>I Timothy 2:5</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we have briefly seen some of the rituals, symbols and teachings of Blue Lodge
				Masonry.  This look has been sufficient to detect some serious concerns and problems which should deeply trouble any discerning Christian
				who is also a member of the Craft.  We will not try to go further into the higher degrees of either the York or Scottish rites.  From what
				I have read about them and from most other accounts and testimonies of those who have studied them more deeply, the teaching only gets more
				pagan.  Some have characterized the Scottish Rite as becoming occultic or Satanic in nature while the York Rite is sometimes defended as
				the "Christian" branch of Freemasonry.  Whatever the case may be, they are both built on the foundation of the Blue Lodge which clearly
				teaches unbiblical views of God and salvation.  That should be enough to reject the viability of simultaneously being a member of the Lodge
				and a believer in Christ.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will ask one more question which I believe is extremely pertinent and also hotly
				debated between the defenders of Freemasonry and its detractors: <b>Is Freemasonry another religion?</b></font></p>

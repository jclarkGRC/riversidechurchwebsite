			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Attraction of the Masonic Lodge:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is it that seems to draw men to Freemasonry?  There may be as many reasons as there
				are members (which, by some estimates, number around four million worldwide with a little less than half being here in the United States)
				but there are some common themes.  Many cite the charitable work that the various Lodges do which greatly benefit the local areas in which
				they reside. In some cases the good that is done affects a much wider community (e.g., Shriners hospitals).  Being involved in such activity
				is seen by most as an extremely positive factor and so it  helps to bring in a number of candidates for membership.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Related to this is a more general idea about what kind of men constitute the membership
				of a Masonic lodge.  Many see the Lodge as an organization for those who are interested in modeling morality.  Steven Tsoukalas asserts
				that what Masons learn in their seeking of the different degrees is to be used to implement "<i>a way of life</i>" which seeks to be
				virtuous and upright (<i>Masonic Rites and Wrongs</i>, p. 5).  This is often reinforced for some by the fact that they notice men in their
				church (sometimes including the minister) who are members of the society.  For a man interested in being a person of good character (or at
				least in being associated with such people) this is also an attractive factor.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some are intrigued by the mystery of Freemasonry.  Earlier in this study, I referred to
				it as a "<i>secret society</i>."  In an internet article, apparently authored by a member, I found that in a technical sense, that may not
				be correct.  It is not a secret society in that they are underground and only those who are personally involved know about them.  Obviously,
				the Lodge buildings, the members’ rings, headgear, other apparel and patches, car ornaments, etc. all testify publicly to their existence.
				But as the author pointed out, it <i>is</i> a society which has secrets.  These mysteries the faithful membership guard in earnest and, no
				doubt, do not appreciate it when former participants reveal them.  Some of the secrets, many would agree, are inconsequential, perhaps even
				juvenile reminding us of a child’s secret club -- handshakes, key words, certain of the rituals and so on.  Others may need to be taken a
				bit more seriously due to what’s involved (more on those later).  The point for now is that there is an attraction to being on the "inside"
				of something secret.    Jack Harris, a former Worshipful Master of his Lodge, gives testimony that "<i>The reasons for my deciding to seek
				membership were based on the mystery, intrigue, and secrecy involved,...</i>" (<i>Freemasonry</i>, p. 11).  No doubt many have been enticed
				to join on the same grounds.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some other prevalent reasons for those who join might be financial considerations (making
				business contacts), or a desire to be part of a fraternity (a club for guys only), and, of course, because all his closest relatives/friends
				belong.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fact that there can be different motives for joining necessarily implies that there
				will be different types of members in the Masonic Lodge.  Tsoukalas (<i>Rites and Wrongs</i>, pp. 1, 10) lists and describes four kinds of
				members:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Those who are inactive, apathetic and largely ignorant of deeper Masonic teachings.  This comprises the vast majority (75-90 percent)
						of membership according to the personal experience of involved participants and documented research surveys.  Inactive members are
						mostly satisfied to get only the three foundational degrees (the Blue Lodge or Craft Lodge degrees) which <i>all</i> members must
						receive before progressing further; to then be identified as a Mason;  to not regularly attend Lodge meetings nor study the Craft
						further but are faithful to pay dues.  Such members are still loyal to the ideals and principles of Freemasonry and believe it is
						valuable to encourage excellence in society.  However, they, no doubt, think they have learned enough and do not need more training
						or do not have time for the extensive memory work involved in obtaining further degrees.  Usually, such members would deny that
						Freemasonry is a religion in itself.  But, as noted above, rarely have they really given thought to many of the deeper issues.
					</li>
					<li>
						Much rarer are those who think that the Masonic Lodge is in reality a religion yet see no conflict in continuing to practice their
						"primary" religion.  This reflects much more involvement, study and thought regarding Freemasonry and its teachings.  They have
						come to the conclusion that adhering to Freemasonry enhances or deepens the "church worship" (or whatever) experience.  This seems
						to be, perhaps, a sort of Gnosticism (a New Testament era heresy) where the Mason believes his special knowledge puts him on a
						different (higher) level as a Christian.
					</li>
					<li>
						Other members believe that Freemasonry <i>is</i> a religion and further, it becomes their only religion.  They believe the teachings
						of the Lodge are all they need.  In believing that they, of course, dedicate much thought, time and energy to the Craft.
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, there are members who having given themselves wholeheartedly to the study and work of Freemasonry, do not believe it is
						a religion at all but merely a civic minded organization dedicated to encouraging goodness, charity and basic morality in society.
						Of course it is from these last three groups that the leaders emerge.
					</li>
				</ol></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So because different men come to the Lodge for different reasons they find different things.
				Some are attracted for surface benefits.  Others find much deeper meaning and dedicate themselves to its teachings accordingly. </font></p>

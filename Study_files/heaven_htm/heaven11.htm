			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question #10:  What will New Jerusalem be like?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems the Lord wants us to know enough about the amazing wonderful place He is
				constructing so that we get excited about it!  The primary source of information about New Jerusalem is in <b>Revelation 21:9-27; 22:1-5</b>.
				Let's run through some of the specific descriptions of the city:
				<ul>
					<li>
						It is very bright -- <b>Rev. 21:11; 22:5</b>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Think the Emerald City of Oz ... multiplied by infinity.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is surrounded by an immense wall with twelve gates -- <b>Rev. 21:12-15, 17-21</b>.
					</li>
					<li>
						The wall itself is made of jasper (a reddish hued stone -- does the color red remind us of anything?).
					</li>
					<li>
						The twelve gates (three each in the four walls) are each made of one pearl (I'd like to see the oysters which produced them!).
					</li>
					<li>
						The twelve gates are named after the twelve tribes of Israel.
					</li>
					<li>
						The measurement of 144 cubits (over 200 feet!) most likely refers to thickness.
					</li>
					<li>
						Each gate is attended by an angel and they are never shut (<b>21:25</b>).
					</li>
					<li>
						The wall also has twelve foundations, each one covered with a precious stone and named for one of the twelve apostles of Jesus
						(remember the concept of continuity?).
						<blockquote>
							NOTE:  Is there a contradiction here?  Why have a big wall with gates if they  never close?  As Randy Alcorn comments, even
							the happiest place on earth, Disneyland, shuts the gates at night!  Even more confusing, if all evil is eliminated by then
							(<b>21:27</b>), why even have a wall at all?  One answer is the wall is a symbolic reminder of God's constant care and
							protection for us through the precious blood of the Lamb.  The open gates could symbolize constant access to God and the
							eternal life He provides in His Son Jesus.  There is no hindrance to the blessings and goodness that God wants to bestow on
							His children.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						It is enormous -- <b>Rev. 21:15-16</b>.  Twelve thousand furlongs equals roughly 1400 miles (2200 kilometers)!  This is the
						measurement for all dimensions, in other words, it is as long as it is wide as it is high! Alcorn shares:
						<blockquote>
							A metropolis of this size in the middle of the United States would stretch from Canada to Mexico and from the Appalachian
							Mountains to the California border. ... Even more astounding is the city's 1,400-mile height.  Some people suggest this is
							the reach of the city's tallest towers and spires, rising above buildings of lesser height.  If so, they argue it's more like
							a pyramid than a cube. ... The ground level of the city will be nearly two million square miles. ... But remember that's just
							the ground level.  Given the dimensions of a 1,400-mile cube, if the city consisted of different levels (we don't know this),
							and if each story were a generous twelve feet high, the city could have over 600,000 stories.  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 242.)
						</blockquote>
						So the gates on each side are hundreds of miles apart.  Imagine such a city with a staggering skyline on a high mountain shining
						like a crystal beacon in all directions ... unimaginably breathtaking!
					</li>
					<li>
						There seems to be a great river and park-like groves right in the middle of the city -- <b>Rev. 22:1-2</b>.  This is not a concrete
						jungle!  People who don't much care for big cities will love New Jerusalem which has all the plusses and no minuses.
						<blockquote>
							Note:  The water and the tree are "of life", the fruit is produced continually and the leaves are for healing.  What does all
							this imply?  Do we need to partake of them regularly?  Perhaps imbibing of the water and consuming fruit from the tree is
							essential to eternal life?  Some think that once we get to Heaven we don't need much of anything in the way of sustenance,
							that God simply changes us to be eternal and indestructible.  But maybe it is more like Adam and Eve in Eden.  Even though
							they were created to live eternally, for death had not entered the scene before the Fall, yet they still needed to eat
							(<b>Gen. 2:16</b>) but God had provided everything they needed so that it took no effort for them to thrive. The fall changed
							that (<b>Gen. 3:17-19</b>).
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							Likewise, Israel in the wilderness was provided manna from day to day and God kept their necessary possessions from wearing
							out.  Just so, in New Jerusalem, it may be that we do have needs but they are all freely provided so that we may thrive
							forever. It makes sense that God would encourage our relationship to and our dependence upon Him rather than independence
							from Him.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						It is overwhelmingly extravagant.  As we read about the gold and precious stones used in the construction and the immensity and
						scale of the design, those things convey to us a picture of unsurpassed beauty and splendor.
						<blockquote>
							NOTE:  If you've ever been in a place owned and decorated by those who have enormous resources at their disposal, you were
							likely  bowled over and told everyone you know about the experience!  I've heard people talk about the Hearst mansion in
							California with awe.  I've been to a few impressive places myself in England and Europe.  I think of some of the scenes in
							the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings where the dwarves and elves built beautiful and enormous buildings for themselves.  That
							seems funny to say but I think that's the kind of  captivating beauty and stunning architecture we will see in New Jerusalem.
							We will be enthralled by this city which has been designed and built by God Himself for His beloved children.  Who knows how
							long we will be just in exploring and visiting our new hometown, much less the rest of the New Earth!  I can't wait to see it
							and experience it!
						</blockquote>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of experiencing the city, can we make some assumptions about New Jerusalem,
				just from what we know from being in cities ourselves?  When you visit a big city such as Seattle, what do you expect to encounter?  Do
				you enjoy it?
				<blockquote>
					NOTE:  We almost always take out-of-town guests into Seattle to see the sights and sounds of the city.  There are things there which
					you can only find in a metropolitan area.  But there are also things I don't care to see or experience. As many have said, I like
					visiting but wouldn't necessarily want to live there.  Randy Alcorn speaks to this:
					<blockquote>
						People have told me they can't get excited about the New Jerusalem because they don't like cities.  But this city will be
						different -- it will have all the advantages we associate with earthly cities but none of the disadvantages.  The city will be
						filled with natural wonders, magnificent architecture, thriving culture -- but it will have no crime, pollution, sirens, traffic
						fatalities, garbage, or homelessness.  It will truly be Heaven on Earth.  If you think you hate cities, you'll quickly change your
						mind when you see this one.  Imagine moving through the city to enjoy the arts, music, and sports without pickpockets, porn shops,
						drugs, or prostitution. (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 245.)
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kristina and I sometimes talk about how interesting it might be to live downtown in
				Seattle, walking around, having time to really explore, being in the middle of the action -- but we want to be there for only a little
				while!  One day, we will get to experience big city life in the best way possible in a forever home built by our Heavenly Father.

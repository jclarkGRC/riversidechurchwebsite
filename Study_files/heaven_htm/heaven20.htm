			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Back to: <a href="heaven19.htm">Question 18</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven21.htm">Question 20</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 19: What might everyday life look like and how might society function in
				Heaven?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have skirted around the edges of this question in previous discussions.  We have
				discovered many things about the possible nature of our bodies and our future existence on the New Earth.  Now we stipulate and concede
				that what we think we may know is woefully limited.  God may change our bodies and situations in ways that go well beyond His original
				design.  But the best way for us to try to grasp what life might be like in Heaven is to think that, for the most part, it will be a matter
				of the restoration of original specifications through the lifting of the curse returning everything to the status of "good."  Based on this
				assumption we have asserted that, on the New Earth, we as redeemed humans will keep our memories and identities, continue to eat, rest and
				sleep, work, learn, desire personal interaction with others and have relationships.  We will enjoy all the good that God originally intended
				without the pain, evil, and death resulting from sin.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That serves as a summary of much of what we have perused and, if true to some degree,
				provides at least some insight into what life will be like in Heaven.  But even so, that  leaves a lot of room for thought and speculation
				about just how the kingdom itself might be organized and how society in Heaven may function.  As stated earlier we will try to find answers
				by asking a series of sub-questions, the first of which is:</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Will we as individuals all be equals in Heaven?</b>  We need to approach this question
				from two perspectives to have a proper understanding of what may be. From one standpoint, we see in Scripture that all individuals are
				deemed equal in intrinsic worth before the Lord and under the law -- cf. <b>Romans 2:11; James 2:1-9</b>.  It is from this viewpoint that
				we usually approach the concept of equality in Heaven.  Because we clearly see the exceedingly harmful effects of racial, economic, and
				cultural discrimination here and now on earth, we cannot imagine such evil attitudes being present in the kingdom of God.  And rightly so.
				In Heaven there will be a full grasp of the concept of the brotherhood of mankind and the actual practice of loving one's neighbor .  No
				arrogance, pride, hatred, or hostility -- imagine it if you can.  It is something to look forward to greatly.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, from another perspective, we will not and cannot be equals in certain ways.  One
				necessary aspect, it seems, of the inequality of individuals in Heaven has to do with that concept of <b>diversity</b> which we have
				referred to several times. It seems the Lord relishes variety.  All aspects of His creation -- the material world, animal life, and
				humanity -- demonstrate this.  This strongly implies that, in our aptitudes, skills and talents, we will not all be equal.  Some will be
				superior to others with regard to certain activities.  We understand how this looks because it is the case now.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does it seem terrible that such differences may also be present in Heaven?  If it does,
				it is probably because the existence of different skill sets in our present world creates some inequities because some abilities are more
				appreciated than others (e.g., the celebration and compensation of great musical, acting, or athletic ability).  But in Heaven a huge
				difference is that there will be no inordinate advantage related to having a particular set of skills.  There will be no deprivation
				because God provides all our needs.  With that being the case, and with our abilities coinciding with our passions, we will not be
				concerned with the skills of others.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In other words, envy and jealousy will be eliminated.  So this aspect of inequality, in
				such a context, is acceptable to our thinking even now.  For if we will take real pleasure in the work and other opportunities our own
				skills and abilities afford us in Heaven and, at the same time, we have no thought that what another person can do somehow grants them
				privileges we do not enjoy, then there will be no sense of unfairness.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have seen that, though the Bible teaches there is no partiality with God regarding
				the intrinsic worth of all people (cf. <b>Rom. 2:11</b>) and condemns discrimination based on a person's appearance or circumstances
				(cf. <b>James 2:1-9</b>), yet in Heaven there will necessarily be some inequality based on the concept of <b>diversity</b>.  We will not
				all have the same aptitudes and abilities.  We also have seen that there is no real problem with this because no one will gain an undue
				advantage in God's kingdom through his/her personal talents and skill sets. We will be happy and content with who we are as God made us.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is, however,  another area where the concepts of inequality, superiority and
				inferiority are even more pronounced.  It is the idea of <b>individuals having positions of authority in Heaven</b>. When Jesus was on
				earth, He often spoke of and referred to Heaven as a <b>"kingdom"</b> and gave many parables about it to His disciples --
				cf. <b>Matthew 13:24, 31, 33, 44, 45, 47</b>.  It goes without saying that Jesus will be the ruler of that kingdom.  Now ... do the
				kingdoms we see now only have a king in authority and no other offices?  No, there are always others in positions of authority serving
				under the king. One immediate concession we must make is that we are talking here about apples and oranges.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A merely human leader, being finite, <b>must</b> have help ruling (cf.
				<b>Exodus 18:13-14, 17-18, 21-22</b>).  But Jesus, fully human yet also fully divine, does <b>not need</b> help to rule.  He is able
				to rule alone and could see to everything Himself since He is not subject to our limitations. But whether He needs other kingdom
				officials is not the final answer to this question.  The Lord could accomplish anything and all things 	without our help yet He has
				chosen to include us in the work of His kingdom in many ways (e.g., evangelism).  So the ultimate answer must come from the Scriptures
				-- cf. <b>Psalm 72:8, 11; I Corinthians 6:2-3; II Timothy 2:12a; Revelation 2:10, 26; 3:11, 21; 4:10; 22:5</b>.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again I concede the full meaning of some of those passages is obscure. However, the
				repeated references to nations, crowns, reigning, judging, etc., heavily implies there will definitely be various locales with the
				accompanying regional positions of authority.  Logically, then, there must be a hierarchy or chain of command (cf. Jethro's advice to
				Moses).  This in turn demands that some rulers are superior to others.  In other words, they have been given more authority.  This
				aligns with Jesus' words about the kingdom -- cf. <b>Luke 19:16-19</b>.  Thus, to return to our basic premise, not all of us will be
				equal in terms of kingdom authority and positions.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That may not seem right to some (perhaps especially us living in a democratic
				republic) who think of nations ruled by royalty as unfair, despotic bastions of unmerited privilege. The thought that we will operate
				within the context of an actual kingdom (instead of maybe more of a commune-like setting) can be a little disconcerting (but remember
				even communes have leadership -- and at times very despotic).  Keep in mind, too, from what we saw in <b>Luke</b>, positions of authority
				granted by the Lord will not be unmerited through chance of birth. Rather they are given based on (now get this) ... humble,
				self-sacrificing service to the Lord and others -- cf. <b>Matthew 20:23-28</b>.  And all believers can gain God's approval in this way
				-- cf. <b>Matthew 6:19-21; II Timothy 4:6-8</b>  This is the big difference in the dynamics of kingdoms of earth and the kingdom of
				Heaven -- those exalted and possessing the greatest authority have it, not because of ambition, self-promotion, "greatness", etc., but
				rather because they have been the most humble and self-sacrificing among God's servants.  There will be many profound surprises when
				rewards and assignments from the Lord are revealed.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember, too, that just as we do not equate positions of authority as equivalent to
				intrinsic worth even now (Is an elected official a better human being overall?), neither will we in Heaven.  Jesus loves and died for
				all of us. He <b>will</b> recognize faithful service and some <b>will</b> be highly honored.  But rather than being envious, we will
				rejoice with them (cf. <b>I Cor. 12:26-27</b>) and will be content with whatever He sees fit to place into our keeping -- cf. Alcorn,
				<b>Heaven</b>, p. 355.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have talked about the possibility of there being certain aspects of inequality among
				those who dwell in Heaven.  Another consideration within our overall question is:</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>In Heaven, will there be privacy, including private ownership?</b>  This, to me, is
				an interesting subject.  Some have imagined Heaven to be and function somewhat like a commune ... but in a good way!  In other words it
				is the true realization of what some, um, let's call them, "visionaries" have attempted to create at various times and places here on
				earth. Though always resulting in the hurting of individuals (if not outright mayhem and murder)  and usually ending in utter failure,
				still their aspiration (granting their true motives the benefit of the doubts) was to create a utopia where everyone contributes to the
				good of the whole according to his abilities and everyone is provided for from the wealth of the whole according to his needs.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everything belongs to everyone and is shared equally and, thus, love, rainbows,
				butterflies and unicorns rule the day.  It sounds great but, as noted above, it hasn't worked out that way generally because those who
				help the commonwealth (commune) through their "ability" to lead always seem to "need" more than the rest of the group and naturally
				"provide" it for themselves.  Since the rest of the group may resent this, the leaders are then forced to maintain control through armed
				force and violence (e.g., the Soviet Union, Communist China, Cuba, North Korea, et al., ad naseum -- also read, if you haven't already,
				George Orwell's Animal Farm for tremendous insight regarding this subject).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Hold on", one might say, "that's here on earth and granted. But we are talking about
				Heaven!  Couldn't Jesus, as the totally unselfish and loving Leader, make the commune system work for Heaven?"  Certainly.  And many
				have conceived of Heaven  being that way at least to some extent.  Randy Alcorn cites the fourteenth century Theologica Germanica:
				<blockquote>
					In Heaven there is no ownership.  If any there took upon him to call anything his own, he would straightway be thrust out into hell
					and become an evil spirit. (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 356.)
				</blockquote>
				 Similarly, several Christian authors state, without biblical references, that people won't own anything in heaven.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is this true?  Well to start, let's consider what we have looked at regarding equality
				in Heaven.  Part of the great attraction of the notion of a commune (or Communism) is that everyone in it will be equal.  But we
				discovered that in Heaven the principle of diversity and the granting of authority by the Lord to certain people (it's a kingdom, not
				a commune) requires some degree of inequality.  So there's one strike. But, as Alcorn suggests, the only way to really answer this is
				to find biblical truth on the matter.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First let's consider just the concept of <b>privacy</b> in Heaven.  We continue to
				assert the idea of restored specifications, thus the experiences of Adam and Eve in Eden may strongly hint at what we can expect in our
				home on the New Earth. We also believe we'll still be ourselves and have many of the same human needs and desires.  So it makes sense
				that then, just as now, there will be times when we will want some solitude, some quiet time, some rest from daily activities.  If this
				is not so then the Lord's promise in <b>John 14:2</b> makes little sense.  Why would we need personal dwelling places if we never want
				to be alone or have privacy? Of course it's possible our dwellings will be like military dormitories with large rooms and bunks but nobody
				I know imagines Heaven like that! Rather, we see them as very personalized abodes, all within the Father's very expansive house or on His
				great estate.  Alcorn also has an interesting take on <b>Luke 16:1-9</b> regarding our personal dwellings and the ideas of privacy,
				hospitality and fellowship.
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						I belive that Scripture teaches that we'll open our homes guests.  I base this on Christ's words in <b>Luke 16</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						After speaking of the shrewd servant's desire to use earthly resources so that "people will welcome me into their houses"
						(<b>v. 4</b>), Jesus told his followers to "use worldly wealth to gain friends" (<b>v. 9</b>). Jesus instructed them use their
						earthly resources to gain friends by making a diference in their lives on Earth. The reason? "So that when it [life on Earth] is
						gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings" (<b>v. 9</b>).
					</p>
					<p>
						Our "friends" in Heaven appear to be those whose lives we've touched on Earth and who now have their own "eternal dwellings".
						<b>Luke 16:9</b> seems to say these "eternal dwellings" of our friends are places where we'll stay and enjoy companionship --
						second homes to us as we move about the Kingdom.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because many people mistakenly believe that Heaven won't be earthlike, it never occurs to them to take this passage literally.
						They think "eternal dwellings" is a general reference to Heaven. But surely Christ isn't saying we'll enter Heaven because we used
						our money wisely. In the parable, the eternal dwellings are Heaven's equivalent to the private homes the shrewd servant could stay
						in on Earth.
					</p>
					<p>
						Do I believe Jesus is suggesting we'll actually share lodging, meals, and fellowship with friends in God's Kingdom? Yes. I'm aware
						that some readers will think this far-fetched. But that's only because when we think of Heaven, we don't think of resurrected people
						living on a resurrected Earth, living in dwelling places, and eating and fellowshipping together. But isn't that <i>exactly</i>
						what Scripture teaches us? (<b><i>Heaven</i></b> p. 323)
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				We are moving from one facet to another of a very large subject, and we will follow up some more on the concept of private ownership.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have looked at how it makes sense that there will not be strict equality in Heaven
				for various reasons, among them that Jesus describes Heaven as a kingdom not a commune.  We spent some time on the desire for and the
				opportunity to have privacy in our own dwellings.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As part of our discussion we considered communism where, theoretically, nobody owns
				anything.  It is all owned by the state which in turn provides for the people as it sees fit (usually meagerly).  Communists/socialists
				see private property and capitalism as "unfair" because access to wealth isn't equal.  So the idea of ownership is evil in their view
				(at least in their system everyone is impoverished -- uhh, except for the leaders).  Some Christians echo that sentiment about owning
				things, at least in the context of Heaven.  Again the idea of "equality" is a factor here.  But is private ownership evil or is it
				certain attitudes which can accompany ownership, like materialism, greed, selfishness, envy, etc.?  And how can ownership be evil when
				God Himself is said to own all things?  <b>Cf. Psalm 24:1; 50:10-11</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some would say that this is exactly the point!  Since the Lord in actuality does own
				all things, it is not even possible to have personal, private property in Heaven.  Alcorn cites an ancient writer who declared that
				"God ... is the only Haver".  He then notes that: "This sounds spiritual, but God is also a giver.  If he gives to us, then we too become
				'havers'."  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 356-57.)  Another thing to consider is that the issue of God's ownership is just as true now in
				this earthly era as it will be in that time of the kingdom of Heaven.  Yet we understand and recognize the reality of legally and
				practically owning material items.  Bible teaching also readily acknowledges this -- cf. <b>Acts 5:1-4</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now let's consider the teachings and implications of other Bible passages:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Revelation 2:17</b> -- We are given a personal name which belongs only to us.  Included in this is the notion of privacy.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Colossians 3:24</b> -- Speaks of a personal inheritance.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Daniel 12:13</b> -- The prophet is personally promised his own inheritance.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Matthew 6:19-21</b> -- We are encouraged by Jesus Himself to lay up treasures for ourselves.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>II Corinthians 5:9-10; I Corinthians 3:11-14</b> -- At the Lord's judgment seat we will possibly receive crowns and rewards.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Romans 8:16-17</b> --  Heirs receive things.
					</li>
				</ol>
				Something to understand is that whatever it is that we may possess personally in the kingdom of Heaven will be ours because God has given
				it to us.  It is His idea to do this and all things are His to bestow as He wishes.  It will not have been obtained through overworking
				or through immoral or through illicit means.  Neither will there be envy or jealousy or conflict over who has what.  But now that does
				not mean everyone will be the same in their possessions -- cf. <b>Luke 19:16-19</b>.  If two people with equal opportunity prove to be
				faithful in different degrees then they will be rewarded accordingly.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does that mean some will be left out entirely?  Left in poverty in Heaven?  Of course
				not.  Think of it this way:  There is an inheritance to be distributed to the children of a large family with several sons and daughters.
				The bulk of the estate is to be divided equally between the heirs -- all the children are provided for generously.  However there are
				certain special items, prized possessions, various keepsakes which signified something special between a parent and one of the children.
				So provision is made in the will (or better yet, a trust) for these specific things to be specially awarded to specific children as a
				token of that special bond.  It is above and beyond the general provision which they all received by virtue of being a child.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus no one is left out, all are provided for generously, and yet some are rewarded
				according to God's good pleasure in their faithfulness.  They are given special things which they can truly call their own.  This is
				consistent with the truth we see in God's word.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far we have discussed the concepts of equality, and privacy/private ownership as they
				may relate to the next life. Next...</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Will there still be ethnic/national identities including different languages in
				Heaven?</b>  I think this is interesting because I believe that the largest reason for conflict in our world has to do with extreme
				differences in national identities, cultures and languages.  I think this is a widely recognized fact, hence all the emphasis on
				"tolerance" these days.
				<blockquote>
					We could spend a long time on the subject of tolerance.  Suffice it to say that it seems to me that often those who preach their
					version of tolerance the loudest are some of the most hostile and intolerant people around.  Their thinking seems to be that society
					must "tolerate" {i.e., legitimize, endorse, encourage} any behavior and ideology <u>except</u> the traditional and moral worldviews
					and practices comprising the very foundations of our society. But I digress ...
				</blockquote>
				Let's discuss briefly why such differences noted above can produce conflict.  Here are a couple of potential reasons:
				<ol>
					<li>
						People from widely differing backgrounds may have problems trusting each other at first.  It's hard to trust people you do not
						understand.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some have the notion their own culture is superior leading them to try to dominate or suppress other cultures in order to eliminate
						what is "bad" or "wrong" about them.
					</li>
				</ol>
				There may be other specific reasons but I think most conflicts between different people groups grow out of these basic attitudes.  In
				general it is very easy for people to quickly reject that with which they're not familiar.  This is pre-judgment or prejudice -- assuming
				that a given thing is true about someone without really investigating or giving them an opportunity to demonstrate who they really are,
				what they truly value, believe, etc.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is an important topic so let's explore it.  It is a simple thing to say that
				prejudice is wrong.  And to a great extent that is true.  Nobody wants to be pre-judged, not given a chance, based merely on externals
				or because of labels applied to us. We may be very different from how we appear in a given moment.  But it is also a bit simplistic to
				expect the complete abandonment of prejudice. That sounds awful, but reality is that it would be almost impossible to eliminate
				pre-judging in our currently constituted world.  Why?  Because, unfortunately, most prejudice grows out of two main issues:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Our basic need and desire for personal safety.
					</li>
					<li>
						Our own limitations with regard to time, energy and resources.
					</li>
				</ol>
				Let me give general credit to the economist Walter Williams for his very insightful thoughts on this subject.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The desire for personal safety is a paramount need coming only after things like air,
				water, food, warmth, etc.  In other words it is very basic so it is not going away.  In order to stay safe, we generally try to avoid
				dangerous situations if possible or take reasonable precautions if we know there is risk (e.g., in the car we buckle seat belts; on a
				hike in the mountains we take extra gear; in a boat we wear lifejackets, etc.).  But I think most would agree that the most common and
				most unpredictable factor in dealing with dangerous situations is other people.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The big problem is that out in public, in places not nearly as safe as our own homes,
				we do not really know most of the people around us.  And, just as importantly, neither do we have the time, energy or resources to invest
				in finding out more about them.  Therefore we are compelled, for safety's sake, to economize so we prejudge them with regard to the risk
				they pose to us.  Some may deny they do this, but I contend it happens so automatically it never rises to a conscious level until we
				notice someone who looks suspicious.  Then we may become more alert to sudden movements or clutch our purses a little tighter or cross
				the street and go a different direction or undo the strap on our holster or whatever it is that is appropriate to the threat level we
				perceive they may pose.  In short, when we are around unknown people, most of us are very alert and constantly assessing them based on
				externals -- what we see them wearing, how they have their hair, the presence of tattoos, piercings, etc., what language they speak and
				what they are saying if we can understand, what they may be smoking or drinking, and their general mannerisms and behavior.  We may not
				like the idea that this happens but it is a fact of life.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, let's say you are walking down a lonely street and a group of young men
				appear out of a building in front of you.  Does it make a difference to your sense of personal security when you see they are clean-cut,
				wearing suits, talking quietly, and carrying Bibles and then you notice the building actually has a cross painted on the front <b>as
				opposed</b> to them being unkempt, heavily tattooed, wearing a lot of leather and chains, speaking with loud profanities, and coming out
				of what looks like a crack house?  I think it does make a difference.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is it <b>wrong</b> to assess each group differently?  I'd say that it is possible
				your pre-judgment may be <b>wrong</b> in that the first group may be insincere and hateful while the second group may have hearts of
				gold.  But since in most cases we do not have the opportunity to really get to know all who cross our paths, we are generally more
				comfortable with people who seem to be more like us based on what we can perceive about them on the outside.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That is part of life in this broken world.  What would absolutely be wrong, however,
				is that in those cases where you do actually have an opportunity to know a person more deeply, you do not even give them a chance based
				merely on their appearance or other externals. If we do this, we sin -- cf. <b>Jam.2:1-4</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Will there still be ethnic/national identities including different languages in
				Heaven?</b>  We have seen that the single biggest reason for conflict has to do with the differences with regard to people's
				nationalities, languages, and cultures and why this is so.  We also explored the concept of pre-judgment (prejudice) of others before we
				get to know them,  why it happens and why, at times, it is necessary in our fallen world.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Realizing all these things it is understandable that some have come to the conclusion
				that, since Heaven will be free of all conflict, it must be that such differences which cause it are removed completely.  Instead there
				will be only one culture and one language.  Admittedly, this is consistent with the absolute truth that all those living on the New Earth
				will be members of just one kingdom belonging to God, so one nation, so to speak.  How do we think about that?  Will there only be one
				culture and language?  In other words, will everything from our time on earth in that regard be erased?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep in mind that much of the conflict we have talked about results from prejudice which
				often stems from concerns for safety and a lack of opportunity to fully know another person before we feel forced to make a decision about
				him or her.  But neither of those things will be the case in Heaven!  Our security is assured because God has removed all sin and therefore
				all threats to our well-being.  And we have all the time we will ever need to become fully acquainted with our heavenly family.  In fact
				we know from the simple fact that we are together in the kingdom of heaven that we share many things in common -- first and foremost, a
				love for Jesus -- and thus have no reason to fear one another.  Things will be radically different from our current experience here and
				now.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember also the two big principles we continually reference -- <b>continuity</b> and
				<b>diversity</b>.  With regard to continuity if we are still ourselves with our own identities and unique DNA, so on and so forth, wouldn't
				that mean that we will retain our distinctive features.  Our skin pigment, eye color and hair would in themselves serve to remind us that
				we are different and, in most cases, had different heritages.  And then thinking of God's seeming delight for diversity it would make
				complete sense that He would want in His kingdom a potpourri of people from all parts of the world with all kinds of differences.  If so
				then why would He then want to homogenize them all into one?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Part of the excitement of traveling even now is the opportunity to experience the vast
				variety of ways people live and work around the world. If God preserves distinctive human cultures in Heaven, we would be able to continue
				to enjoy that but with no negative or restrictive factors which we face now.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But as always the most important evidence for what we are discussing about Heaven is
				not what we can logically deduce but rather what the Bible actually says -- cf. <b>Revelation 5:8-10; 7:9; 21:24-26</b>.  On p. 362 of
				his book <b><i>Heaven</i></b>, Randy Alcorn comments:
				<blockquote>
					Who will serve  as the New Earth's kings and priests?  Not people who were formerly of every tribe, language, people and nation.
					Their distinctions aren't obliterated but continue into the intermediate Heaven and then into the eternal Heaven.  Tribe refers to
					a person's clan and family lineage.  People refers to race.  Nationality refers to those who share a national identity and culture.
					Dutch theologian Herman Bavinck said of the New Earth, "All those nations -- each in accordance with its own distinct national
					character -- bring into the New Jerusalem all they received from God in the way of glory and honor."  Like the current earthly
					Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem will be a melting pot of ethnic diversity.  But unlike the current city, the groups in the New
					Jerusalem will be united by their common worship of King Jesus.  They will delight in each other's differences, never resent or
					be frightened by them.
				</blockquote>
				That will be a glorious and wonderful time indeed!  Now let us focus on the language component of all this.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far we have covered the problem of prejudice and conflict between different cultures
				and nationalities, and have also seen that in Heaven those issues are resolved because insecurity, hatred, arrogance and all that separates
				us will be removed.  All God's people are united in Christ.  God delights in diversity and wants His kingdom to be made up of all the
				people groups of the world.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, according to the Bible, He will redeem some of each one.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We want now to talk about the idea of what language or languages we may be speaking in
				Heaven.  Something that may be helpful as we think about this is to consider how and why did different languages come into being in the
				first place.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of us realize that <b>Genesis 11:1-9</b> holds the answer.  After the flood only one
				family remained and it seems they spoke only one language.  As <b>vv. 1, 6</b> relates, this continued for some time -- long enough for a
				decent population to grow it seems.   There was no reason to invent another language and since the people had stayed together there was no
				chance even for distinct dialects to develop.  But to thwart their disobedient and arrogant intention of building one city to stay together,
				God caused confusion in their languages.  This resulted in groups separating from each other and moving to other parts of the globe as the
				Lord intended in the first place.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is the take away from that history lesson?  First, we see that various languages
				came about as a result of man's disobedience and rebellious intent.  Also the original purpose of creating these different languages by
				God was to divide mankind so they could not be united in all their purposes.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Applying this to Heaven, we might ask a couple of questions:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Will there be a problem of sin and rebellion in Heaven?
					</li>
					<li>
						Will there be a need for mankind to be divided by language?
					</li>
				</ol>
				The answer to both is "No."  Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that all of God's people, citizens of one kingdom, will be able to
				efficiently and effectively communicate with each other.  I know of no one who thinks that there will be any barriers between those who
				dwell with Christ in the New Earth.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How might this be accomplished?  It could be done in several ways:
				<ol>
					<li>
						The Lord could do something along the lines of <b>Acts 2:5-6</b>.  But, in this case, rather than actually hearing their own
						language from those not knowing it (the gift of tongues), I have in mind more of a universal translation effect.  No matter what
						language you speak, the person listening can understand (sort of a gift of "ears" or hearing).  Some think this is what happened
						in <b>Acts 2</b> anyway, arguing that this represented a reversal of what happened in Genesis 11.  Whereas Babel broke us apart,
						Jesus reunites us.  It's a nice thought but I disagree because the gift of tongues was about something else entirely.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Lord could remove our earthly languages and instill in us the original language of mankind.  Maybe the one Adam and Eve spoke
						and was passed down to Noah's family before the time of Babel?  This would also represent a reversal -- man's attempt to establish
						a kingdom divided us while God's kingdom  reunites us for eternity. As an aside there are some (mostly Jews of course) who think the
						language of Heaven will definitely be Hebrew.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Lord could give us a universal "language of Heaven" while allowing us to retain our knowledge of the languages we had on earth.
						This would be in keeping with those concepts of continuity and diversity we keep bringing up (over and over and over...). A
						potential problem with this one is, if various earthly languages were truly a judgment on rebellion, would God even want them in
						His kingdom?  Or perhaps the new language of Heaven is so perfect and complete that old earthly languages fade into obsolescence,
						being worthless.
					</li>
				</ol></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us consider some more "fanciful" questions about this subject. So far we have
				discussed the idea that conflict is often the result of our distinctions in nationality, culture, and language due to several reasons
				like lack of trust, prejudice, arrogance toward other people groups, or fear of the differences we see in others. These feelings and
				factors can lead to tension and hostility between those who have different backgrounds.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have also seen that in Heaven these issues will be resolved because we are united
				in Christ and all part of one kingdom.  And we have seen from the scriptures that it seems very clear that God wants representatives
				from every people group on the present earth to be in His new, eternal kingdom.  Thus we'll have the benefit of getting to know other
				cultures with no concerns regarding trust, fear, arrogance or hostility we may presently encounter when we travel.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's consider some not so critical aspects of this.  Will people of particular
				backgrounds tend to gather together or will everyone be dispersed randomly?  Or to put it in today's terms: will there be the equivalent
				of "Chinatowns" or "Little Italy's" in Heaven?  It seems to me that there is no direct answer.  And it likewise seems to me that this is
				a neutral matter.  Who cares where people live?  It also seems that since God is preparing the dwelling places and the city itself, He
				will be deciding those dynamics.  I do think it would be extremely convenient and fun to be able to travel to specific places and really
				immerse yourself in a particular culture -- go to their "turf," so to speak ... with none of the gang-like aspects.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another kind of whimsical question has to do with clothing in Heaven.  We have
				discussed and decided that we will not be like Adam and Eve were in the Garden -- "naked and unashamed". <b>Revelation 3:5</b> speaks
				of white garments and <b>6:11</b> speaks of white robes.  So is that it -- that's all we ever wear?  It could be and I'll not complain
				if that is the case because I like comfort and I hate choosing my wardrobe -- so simple, limited choices are good for me.  But to think
				of everyone walking around in one color and one style smacks more of a futuristic, dystopian society where all differences are tightly
				controlled than it does of Heaven. So I wonder if there won't be more variety in clothing.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our oft referred to concept of diversity points to that.  And also continuity would
				mean that probably at least a few people in Heaven feel differently about clothes than I do (weird, I know).  Those involved in designing
				and creating clothing on earth may want to continue because they loved it.  So could this mean that different people groups may want to
				adorn themselves in some of their traditional dress and costume at times?  Or maybe most of the time?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maybe that, along with their physical appearance, will help us discern the tremendous
				variety of people that our great God has redeemed through Jesus.  It would certainly brighten and liven up the Great City!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, what about cultures and nations lost in the annals of time?  Will they be
				revived and reestablished?  Alcorn speaks to this:
				<blockquote>
					I interpret "every tribe and language and people and nation" literally.  God chose people in even predominantly pagan nations and
					reached them by sending men and women or angels, dreams, and visions.  What people groups will be worshiping Christ on the New Earth?
					Celts, Goths, Huns, Lombards, Saxons, Vikings, ... and countless other civilizations, ancient and modern.  Representatives of nations
					and cultures that no longer exist today will be raised, to God's glory, in a purified form that includes whatever pleased God and
					excludes whatever didn't.  Do you have a special interest in Europe of the Middle Ages?  Then perhaps you'll enjoy developing
					relationships with those who lived in that era.  Perhaps on the New Earth you'll live in a beautified version of their culture.
					(We shouldn't assume that all ancient people would embrace every modern convenience, even when given the choice.)
					(<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 368-69)
				</blockquote>
				After thinking about possible ethnic, national and linguistic carryovers from the present earth into the kingdom of Heaven, let's now turn
				to another sub-question of this overarching topic:</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Will there still be the development and participation in things like arts,
				entertainment and sports in the kingdom of heaven?</b>  Of course we are necessarily speculating about Heaven to some degree, so room for
				disagreement must be allowed.  But this question could elicit strong reaction from either side.  Why?  Those who deny these activities
				will be in heaven might say they are, at best, a frivolous waste of time  accomplishing little and, at worst, are commonly used these days
				to undermine morality and decency.  Surely the Lord would not allow such trivial and often indecent pursuits into His kingdom.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those who disagree and think redeemed mankind will surely engage in the arts and other
				recreational activities might say:
				<ol>
					<li>
						In eternity "time" as such is not in short supply so worries about wasting it are moot.
					</li>
					<li>
						Whatever is in Heaven will be sanctified so only good can come from it, never indecency or immorality.
					</li>
					<li>
						Hasn't the Lord already shown Himself in creation and in history to be artist, playwright and mighty warrior through His great works?
					</li>
				</ol>
				Which is right?  Do either or both ideas have any weight?  The answer one favors may come down to his approach to living life.  Some
				rarely allow time to relax or have fun -- everything to them is very serious all the time.  Work, work, work!  And they may have a valid
				point.  God gives us life for a larger purpose than just having fun and being entertained.  Much of life requires us to be serious and
				work hard so as to accomplish His purposes for us.  Thus those with a temperament which focuses mainly on what they deem to be the
				important tasks of life are likely to affirm the first answer that there will be no silly frivolity going on in Heaven -- no arts,
				entertainment, nor any (especially not any) sports.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Others take another tack to life.  They think that having experiences which are
				entertaining and fun and exciting are also a very valid part of life.  They would likely say that taking breaks from the serious work of
				life to relax and enjoy activities related to arts, entertainment and sports actually increases their productivity because such times
				"recharge a person's batteries" after a protracted period of grinding toil.  And they might even say that the enjoyment of life is more
				in line with what the Lord intended for mankind in the first place. So why wouldn't these activities be made available in Heaven?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what should we think?  Before we answer, let's look back on our lives so far and
				try to recall a few of our fondest memories.  Now consider what these various memories might have in common.  I will go ahead and suggest
				that most of them involve some, if not all, of the following: friends, family, food, conversation, physical activities, creativity,
				fun-filled laughter.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, if we once more assert the principle of continuity that some of the things we see
				in this world (the good) continuing on into the kingdom of God on the New Earth, isn't it likely that some of the same elements will also
				be involved in the memories we will be making in Heaven?  I think so.  But what does the Bible say?  Consider <b>Luke 6:21, 23;
				Revelation 19:9</b>.  The reformer Martin Luther said, "If you're not allowed to laugh in Heaven, I don't want to be there."  Laughter
				is good for the soul -- cf. <b>Proverbs 17:22</b>. It is an expression of joy which, when shared, brings and bonds people together.
				Laughter is of God, not the devil.  He seems to enjoy fun and creativity -- look at some of the creatures He made just for fun, it seems,
				like monkeys, giraffes, kangaroos, etc.  And He put that in us -- our sense of humor is from the Lord.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And He is making a place where such things are dominant.  Right now a fun time or a
				vacation is a welcome respite from our daily lives which is why such memories so often stand out.  But Heaven is going to be
				<b>characterized</b> by joy and good  experiences!  There laughter, good food, good company,  exciting activity will be the <b>norm</b>,
				not the exception.  C.S. Lewis said, "Joy is the serious business of Heaven."   Here on earth now, the person who wants to demonstrate
				a good work ethic lives by the "work before pleasure" principle.  But in Heaven, on the New Earth, "pleasure" is the chief "business"
				at hand. Considering this,it seems appropriate that the arts, entertainment, and sports will still have a place on the New Earth in God's
				kingdom.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assuming this is true, what kinds of events might we expect to experience in Heaven
				specifically?  Or to put it another way, what sort of activities are especially effective at eliciting joy and laughter from us (humanity
				as a whole, not every individual). Consider the following areas and the reasoning:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Music, singing, dancing</b>.  The Bible is full of music from the books of Moses to the Psalms and temple worship to the
						"new song" being sung in Revelation.  Most people enjoy at some types of music now.  If so, it makes sense that we will continue
						to enjoy it then.  Will some current music survive?  Obviously it would seem that it must have certain qualities (e.g.,
						glorifying to God) to be able to be allowed into Heaven.  it may be that some composers with their new, enhanced minds to adapt
						and improve some of their earthly songs.  Will we all become accomplished musicians?  Given, as just noted, our upgraded abilities
						and the unlimited time we could devote to practice, there is little doubt anyone could become adept.  But because it seems God
						desires diversity rather than sameness, it stands to reason some will be naturally better than others and that many will give
						attention to other things than music.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Fine arts</b>.  Isn't it reasonable to expect that, in God's kingdom, not only will our abilities be enhanced but our creativity
						will as well?  It doesn't make sense that the Lord would squelch or restrict that inherent desire to make something beautiful that
						so many people express even now. So it makes sense that redeemed mankind, with no constraints in time or resources, would be more
						inclined to draw, paint, sculpt, cast metal, blow glass and engage in so many other art forms, all for God's glory.  Who knows?
						-- perhaps the Lord is leaving some (or much) of His new city unadorned so that His people throughout eternity can supply the
						statues, murals, and focal points of decoration and beauty. Not because we could ever do anything better than He, but because He
						seems to enjoy including us in His doings.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Drama/comedy</b>.  What is better than a good story to entertain, enthrall and inspire?  This can happen in as simple a setting
						as a group of friends swapping tales or as elaborately as a full blown theatrical production accompanied by a thousand piece
						orchestra.  Most of us like good stories. When I watch a show or movie, I have never been overly concerned about having crystal
						clear video or surround sound audio. Those are nice but much more important to me is just simply to be able to follow the
						storyline and know what is happening in the plot.  It seems likely there will still be stories to tell in the New Earth.  Or
						reproductions of the Greatest Story Ever Told.  Will there still be movies produced in the New Earth? Good question. Movies have,
						by and large, replaced live plays because of time and location restraints which prevent people from attending, say for instance,
						a Broadway production.  Such constraints would seemingly be mostly eliminated in Heaven and people will no doubt have more
						opportunity to be present for such if they chose.  Yet, being human means we still cannot be in two places at once (I think,
						anyway!). So perhaps there will still be a place for the cinematic arts (though no doubt the technology will be greatly enhanced).
						I guess we'll see.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Books and literature</b>.  Many of the same principles apply here as with drama and movies.  Perhaps the information will not
						be delivered in paper form (that's already becoming the case) but new stories will be lived out among God's people in eternity
						and will beg to be told.  I also think God will continue to allow mankind the opportunity to explore His universe and discover
						new truths and apply them.  Those who do so will, no doubt, want to share their findings.  And of course in general those who
						have the aptitude and desire to write will be able to do so at a greater and higher level, due, as we have already discussed,
						to enhanced abilities and deeper, more profound and insightful thinking.  Will there continue to be the literary genre of
						fiction?  That's an interesting question.  Most popular fiction tends to be very unrealistic or it involves the bizarre and the
						supernatural or it is a foray into the shadowy and unsavory aspects of human behavior.  Certainly those sorts of stories would
						not appear.  But not all of it is like that, e.g., C.S. Lewis, Stephen Lawhead, Ted Dekker, who tell their stories to glorify God
						and to make important points about us and Him.  Perhaps the bigger question is:  Will there be a need for such literature in a
						situation where our desires for interesting and exciting experiences can be had very readily in our own lives since time, energy
						and resources will not be lacking and further we, as God's redeemed people, already realize the main point?
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Sports and games</b>.  Just as God has gifted some to be especially adept at singing, drawing, writing, etc., so He made some
						who are talented at and love physical activities.  Thus, as we have supposed before, while everyone may have increased physical
						abilities in general, there still may be some who are still better at sports naturally due to their natural talent and their
						attention to it (practice).  So there still may be a great appreciation for those who can perform extraordinary athletic feats.
						There may still be competitive team sports with established teams and leagues. There may also be entirely new games and rules.
						Such things can bring joy and excitement to those who follow it.  Obviously those who play will not be idolized or overly
						compensated as is the case now. But more generally I think sports will also exist on all levels just as they do now.  I think with
						our new improved bodies we will enjoy exercise and competition just as much and even more than we may now.  Competition?  There
						may be such a thing as "losing" in Heaven?  Why not?  Losing a contest is not inherently evil nor does it have to result in
						hard feelings.  I have lost at sports and games many times while still enjoying the overall experience.  What about what are
						often referred to as extreme sports?
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								Someone might say, "I like mountain climbing and extreme sports. I enjoy working hard and sweating. But there won't be
								any challenges in Heaven. If there's no risk of falling and dying, it can't be really fun."
							</p>
							<p>
								Where does Scripture say there won't be challenges or hard work in Heaven? Were there no challenges in Eden? The Bible say's
								there will be no more evil or suffering - <i>not</i> that there won't be challenges.
							</p>
							<p>
								Did Adam and Eve work hard? Did they sweat and get sore? Everyone who enjoys sports knows that there's "good tired" and a
								"good sore". it's satisfying. Why wouldn't our resurrection bodies sweat? God didn't create sweat glands <i>after</i> the
								Fall, did He?
							</p>
							<p>
								Why couldn't we tumble while climbing on the New Earth? Won't there be gravity? Adam and Eve couldn't die, but couldn't they
								skin their knees? God didn't originally create bodies without nerve endings, did He? Perhaps they could fall, do minor damage,
								then heal quickly. We're told that on the New Earth there'll be no more death, crying, or pain (<b>Revelation 21:4</b>). but
								we're also told, "The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations" (<b>Revelation 22:2</b>). No one will suffer or
								die on the New Earth, but this passage suggests that there might be enough minor damage to require healing.
							</p>
							<p>
								But even if there's absolutely <i>no</i> injury, fear of injury and death aren't essential to excitement, are they? If you
								knew that in thirty years there hadn't been a single fatality on a roller coaster, couldn't you still be thrilled by the
								ride? When our daughters were small, they experienced the thrill of rides at the fair as I held them tightly. The fun was
								in moving fast, spinning around, feeling the wind on their faces. In the same way, couldn't we parachute from a plane and
								have an exhilarating free fall even if we knew their was a zero percent chance of dying? (Some of us might consider that
								<i>more</i> fun, not less.)
							</p>
							<p>
								I believe our resurrection bodies will have adrenaline and the ability to feel. On the New Earth we may experience adventures
								that make our current mountain climbs, surfing, sky diving, and upside-down roller coaster rides seem tame. Why do I say this?
								It's more than wishful thinking. It's an argument from design. We take pleasure in exhilarating experiences not because of
								sin but because <i>God wired us this way</i>. We wern't made to sit all day in dark rooms, watching actors pretend to live
								and athletes do what we can't. We were made to live vibrant lives. Some of us are physically limited, and others are
								emotionally unable to handle too much excitement. But those are just temporary conditions. There's a new world coming -- and
								a new <i>us</i>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because God's design wasn't an accident -- because He doesn't make mistakes -- we can be sure that excitement and exhilaration
								will be more, not less, a part of our experience in Heaven than it is now.
							</p>
							<p>
								Those who know God and believe His promise of bodily resurrection can dream great dreams.
							</p>
							<p>
								One day we will <i>live</i> those dreams. (<b><i>Heaven</i></b> , pp. 412-13)
							</p>
						</blockquote>
					</li>
				</ol>
				To conclude this section we need to be reminded perhaps that all of these activities and events will be <b>redeemed</b> just as we are.  The
				overt sensuality of some dances, the questionable aspects of some drama, the humor that belittles and mocks, the art that promotes
				immorality, the music which is chaotic and does not glorify God, the bitterness and cheating associated with sports -- all of it -- will
				be gone.  All of the evils associated now with the creative arts, entertainment, and sports will be removed leaving only inspiration,
				excitement, awe, enjoyment, camaraderie, conversation, laughter and fun.  All of the good and none of the bad.  How cool will that be?
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This will be the last sub-question for this bigger consideration:</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Will there still be technological innovation and invention by humans in the kingdom
				of Heaven or will there be no need?</b> My hunch is that many, if not most, Christians would say there will be no need for God's people
				in Heaven to do such things.  Some possible reasons that they might give are:
				<ol>
					<li>
						At that point everything will be perfect so nothing new would be required.
					</li>
					<li>
						Perhaps Heaven will be a return (to some degree) to a "natural state" (like Eden) so technology, and thus inventors, would be out of place.
					</li>
					<li>
						Modern technology is so tainted and entwined with the proliferation of evil in the world that it is hard to imagine it in Heaven.
					</li>
				</ol>
				While it is not hard to understand the logic and feelings related to these reasons, we need to find out if they are biblical.  So let's
				look at a few different areas related to human invention and innovation and see if we can find some guiding principles from God's word.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Craftsmanship</b>.  We might define this as the ability to fashion objects of beauty
				or function in a way that is pleasing to the beholder or user.  Those who can craft things often are innovative or have to invent ways to
				create what they are trying to make.  Is there value placed on craftsmanship in the Bible?  There seems to be -- cf.
				<b>Exodus 31:1-6 (35:30-35)</b>.  Randy Alcorn (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 427) comments that this is the first mention in the Bible of
				anyone being "filled with the Spirit of God".  Not a prophet nor a priest, but a craftsman.  Another of his thoughts (p. 428) is that it
				may have been no accident that Jesus was born into a family of carpenters.  Carpenters are "makers" similar to God and so Jesus, as the
				Son of God, would feel right at home.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since God does not change, it seems reasonable that He will still value and allow human
				craftsmanship in Heaven.  We've already talked about the possibility of the Lord allowing some who love such creative work to help adorn
				New Jerusalem.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Innovation and business</b>. When a person has a brilliant idea or a new way to provide
				a product or service, often it results in a lucrative business opportunity.  It may well be that profit wasn't his or her driving force
				originally, but when there is a true innovation, usually people want to have it and are willing to pay for it.  Thus innovation is often
				linked closely to profit, trade, and business.  Some may say that such things won't be in Heaven. Alcorn responds (pp. 428-29):
				<blockquote>
					I believe we will see trade and business in Heaven, although not for all the same reasons we engage in them now.  There's much more to
					business and trade than putting food on the table and repairing the roof, though those are good reasons.  Business is the result not
					of sin but of human interdependence, creativity, and variety.  To say we will not "need" money or goods or services on the New Earth
					doesn't close the discussion.  We may not "need" homes, food, and drink either, but we'll enjoy them nevertheless. ...
					<p>
						People trade and engage in business for reasons besides survival.  It's possible that business as we know it could be replaced by
						a social structure 	centered on creating, giving, and receiving.  An artist might create a beautiful work and simply give it away
						for someone's delight, just as Christ freely gives of Himself.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether you work in a bookstore, bakery or school, don't you experience joy in using your knowledge, skills, services and products
						to help and please others?  Sure it's good and often necessary to earn money, too, but that isn't the ultimate joy.  If we dismiss
						the likelihood of business and commerce on the New Earth, we send the wrong message: that business and commerce are part of the
						Curse, inherently unspiritual or unimportant to God. On the contrary, God's word tells us, "Whatever you do, work at it with all
						your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward.
						It is the Lord Christ you are serving" (<b>Col. 3:23-24</b>).  We work for him on the present earth, and we will work for him on
						the New Earth.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				Thus if all that is true, people may continue to grow and find new and better ways to do whatever it is they do in the kingdom.  That is
				what innovation means.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Technology and machinery</b>.  Many people today see technology as more of a bad thing
				than good.  Certainly it is fair to say that the development of technology and machinery has enabled evil and immorality to spread enormously
				and reach new levels of intensity.  A few examples which may be cited are modern weapons used to harm and take lives, the internet as a
				vehicle of evil propaganda and pornography, the facilitation of amazing prosperity which encourages materialism, and even the provision
				of excessive avenues of amusement which leads to much wasted time and energy.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of these reasons some Christians think that life in God's kingdom on the New
				Earth may be more simple, even rustic, without all the technology we have today.  There is an appeal to that notion.  Most people long for
				simpler times and romanticize the thought of living in a slow paced, rural, peaceful environment.  However many who do so forget how much
				manual labor it took each day because there was no modern technology and machinery.  Also we need to remember that even the simple living
				we may be so nostalgic for still required some degree of technology.  It may have only been a wheel, a pulley, a fulcrum and lever or
				horsepower but man has always made use of the resources he could utilize to make his work easier.  And that is the essence of what
				technology is -- mankind discovering the principles of God's orderly creation and then building the necessary tools to make practical use of
				those principles for his own benefit.  That is part of God's plan that mankind have dominion -- cf. <b>Genesis 1:28; 2:15</b>.  Realizing
				that we see that technology, per se, is not evil in and of itself but rather is a natural outgrowth of the way God designed us to be.  We
				are made in His image to be creative.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is true that technology can be utilized to destroy, wreak havoc, and make possible much
				more evil.  But that is because mankind in this world is sinful and broken and, like Satan does, takes good things and perverts them to
				wicked ends.  But, as noted many times, those evil propensities and the desire to sin will be removed in God's kingdom thus purifying all
				uses of any technology which might be created.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But that begs another familiar question -- will we even need to develop new technology?
				Won't God have done everything so well that there is nothing more for mankind to figure out or create or improve?  That is possible.  But
				that doesn't seem to be the way God operates for the most part.  Typically He does not do for us those things which we can develop or
				provide for ourselves (e.g., once Israel entered Canaan, the manna stopped).  If God does restore mankind to original specifications, it
				stands to reason that the mandate to have dominion would still be in force.  Of course, Jesus, Son of man, will be the ultimate authority,
				but He will delegate certain roles, work, and offices to His people.  For us as a group to do His complete will it may be that we still have
				some learning and inventing to do.  He didn't  give all skills and knowledge to Adam and Eve up front because some technologies were
				developed later -- cf. <b>Genesis 4:19-22</b>. Maybe the same need for progress will be true in Heaven.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What if God's full will for us is that we explore and have dominion over the far reaches
				of the universe but He will wait until we develop the technology to get there ourselves?  Oh that could never happen, you say.  Maybe not
				-- it's just a thought.  On the other hand, who before the 20th century would have thought we'd ever even make it to the moon?   And
				eternity is a long time for research and development.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will turn now to a topic which I think may bring a greater hope and longing for Heaven
				if it indeed turns out to be true.  Of what do I speak?  To begin let me ask a couple of questions:
				<ul>
					<li>
						What is the worst feeling or emotion a human can experience? I am going to suggest to you that it is deep regret.  Why?  Because
						other negatives like physical pain, anger, sorrow over life events can eventually heal or dull or go away. But regretting a missed
						opportunity or a dream unfulfilled or a life-changing bad choice has the capacity to haunt one for the rest of his or her life.
					</li>
					<li>
						What would be the one thing that would have the ability to mitigate or eliminate the terrible feeling of regret? The answer is: A
						second chance which is successfully taken!
					</li>
				</ul>
				Hence our next question:

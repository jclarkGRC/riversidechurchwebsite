			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 8: When God remakes the earth (<b>Rev. 21:1</b>) as our eternal dwelling
				place, what features may stay and which ones may not?"</i></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To cut to the chase, what we are asking is: "Does God wipe out everything so that mankind
				begins again at Ground Zero (so to speak)?  Would it be like after Noah's flood?"  Randy Alcorn writes:
				<blockquote>
					Some people assume that the New Earth will "start over" with Eden's original paradise.  However, Scriptures demonstrate otherwise.
					The New Earth ... includes a carryover of culture and nations.  History won't start over with the New Earth any more than history
					started over when Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden.  Eden was part of history.  There was a direct continuity from the
					pre-Fall world to the post-Fall world.  Similarly, there will be direct continuity between the dying old Earth and the resurrected
					New Earth. ... Culture won't regress to Eden where musical instruments hadn't yet been invented or where metalworking and countless
					other skills hadn't yet been developed (<b>Genesis 4:20-22</b>).  The fact that God mentions in Scripture these and other examples of
					technological progress suggests that he approved of the use of creativity and skills to develop society, even though people were
					hampered by the Curse. [Now citing Albert Wolters]:
					<blockquote>
						By analogy, salvation ... means a restoration of culture and society in their present stage of development.  That restoration
						will not necessarily oppose literacy or urbanization or industrialization or the internal combustion engine, although these
						historical developments have led to their own distortions or evils.  Instead, the coming of the kingdom of God demands that
						these developments be reformed ... that they be subjected to the ordinances of the Creator.
					</blockquote>

				So it seems perhaps that many things we will see in the New Earth will be carried from the old Earth.  Let's leave aside the city of New
				Jerusalem for now and talk about other features of the New Earth:</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Places and geography:</b>  So ... will God erase it all (e.g. Mt. Rainier, Snoqualmie
				Falls, etc.) or will He preserve much of it? If the concept of continuity (especially regarding our personal history) holds true, we want
				some places to be familiar because many of our fondest memories are associated with places.  A caveat is that a place precious to one may
				be loathsome to another.  Another thought is that many geographical features probably came into being as a result of the flood which came
				because of sin.  Will God want those around?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Oceans:  Revelation 21:1</b> says <b>"no more sea"</b>.  Bummer.  Most people these
				days enjoy large bodies of water.  But it's important to note that to the people of John's day, the sea was scary.  Ships tried to stay in
				sight of land because a cloudy day would get them lost on the open sea.  The sea was a barrier between nations, took countless lives, was
				cold, and you can't drink the water.  The promise of "no more sea" was much better to them than to us.  Some assert that the salt water
				of the oceans acts as a great vat of antiseptic to continually cleanse and make life possible on a fallen, polluted earth.  In the New
				Earth, that will not be true so the <b>"sea"</b> as such isn't needed.  But there still may be large bodies of water, especially since
				God originally created <b>"great sea creatures and fish"</b> (<b>Genesis 1:20-21</b>) and called it <b>"good"</b>.  If such are in the
				New Earth, they will need a home.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Weather and seasons:</b>  Humans are hard to please. People in cold climates want
				warmth, people in hot climates want cool.  Some people want constant 72 degrees and sunshine.  Others like a variety.  We are not told that
				seasons came with the Fall but before it (<b>Genesis 1:14</b>).  Some teach that a vapor canopy moderated the earth's temperature and
				created a greenhouse effect with higher air pressures.  Will God restore that?  For that matter will we even have a sun?  Some think that
				<b>Revelation 22:5</b> indicates we will not.  But it only says we will not need the light, not that the sun isn't there.  What about
				gorgeous sunrises and sunsets?  Maybe we can go to other planets for that.  I'm not too worried about a dearth of natural beauty in the
				New Earth. But that brings up a final thought: "Is it possible we'll miss things not carried over from the old Earth?"  </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alcorn uses the analogy of being upgraded from economy to first class on a flight
				(<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 269).  You get all the benefits with none of the liabilities.  Would you miss being crowded in the back of
				the plane?  Just so, anything we might miss from the old Earth will be there in the New Earth. How do I know?  Because I know the
				character of our Lord who delights in giving us good things (<b>Rom. 8:32</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are trying to imagine in a sanctified manner (i.e., staying consistent with Scripture)
				what our eternal home in Heaven will be like.  We have considered some familiar features of Earth that the Bible indicates will likely
				remain.  Let's now turn our attention to a much more fundamental issue.

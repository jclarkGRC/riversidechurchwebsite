			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven05.htm">Question 4</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 3: Is the current dwelling place of God (or Heaven) only a spiritual
				place or does it have physical/material properties, too?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's start by getting some first impressions to the question.  Some have strong feelings
				about this.  Randy Alcorn tells of a man who felt if heaven is physical then it is "less sacred and special". (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>,
				p. 51.)  For support he used <b>John 4:24</b> which says "God is Spirit".  There are varying thoughts regarding this.
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider the belief called Platonism?  It's the idea that material or physical things
			are inherently base and that immaterial or spiritual things are inherently sacred. This belief influenced Christianity through the heresy
			of Gnosticism.  The group commonly known as Christian Scientists still teach this view.  It may be some are hindered from considering that
			the current Heaven could have physical properties because they think in terms of what Alcorn calls <b>Christoplatonism</b>
			(<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 52).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us consider <b>John 4:24</b> which states that God is Spirit.  Now ... does it
			matter as far as Heaven is concerned?  Or, in other words, does the Lord need Heaven as a dwelling place?  Since He created it, he must
			have existed outside of it at some point.  Thus He probably did not design it with Himself in mind.  He is self-sufficient and can dwell
			anywhere, but He knew others would be living there also:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Angels are also spirit (<b>Heb. 1:7,14</b>) but we see them exist and interact in the material world we inhabit (e.g., <b>Acts 12:7</b>).
				</li>
				<li>
					Humans are created with both physical and spiritual components.
				</li>
			</ul>
			The question is: can we (as we are) comfortably exist in a completely non-physical abode?  It does not seem likely.  It makes sense therefore
			that the Lord would adapt Heaven to our liking and our needs since He does not need accommodation Himself.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All this is logically interesting but is there any biblical indication that the Intermediate
			Heaven has physical properties?  Consider the following:  <b>Revelation 7:9; 8:6; 15:8; 19:14.</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are the people, clothes, palm branches, musical instruments and horses real?  Why not?  Some
			say that since Revelation is apocalyptic literature there is a lot of figurative speech so it may be these things are symbolic, not literal.
			That is a valid argument to some (at least it weakens the argument) so let's go to some other places.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Look at Hebrews <b>8:3-5; 9:23-24; 12:22 (cf. Rev.21:2)</b>. The writer of Hebrews strongly
			implies that the things of earth are copied from the originals in heaven.  If the New Jerusalem we spoke of last time is currently in heaven,
			and is to come down and be part of a physical New Earth, wouldn't that at least suggest that the city is physical now and thus part of a
			physical Heaven?</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, what about <b>Luke 23:43; Revelation 2:7; 22:1-2; Genesis 3:24</b>?  Jesus told the
			thief he would join the Lord in "Paradise" which seems to equate it with Intermediate Heaven.  In <b>Revelation</b> we see that the tree of
			life, last seen in the Garden of Eden in Genesis, is currently in Paradise.  By the way, Eden was never destroyed as far as we know, so where
			is it?  Could it be that God removed the Garden of Eden (tree of life and all) to Heaven and placed it within the gargantuan city
			(cf. <b>Rev. 21:16</b>) as a nice city park? Don't we do that (e.g. Central Park in New York City)?  Wouldn't that be another example of us
			"copying" the heavenly?  It seems that the tree of life at least is coming down with the New Jerusalem.  All of that implies that, at least as
			far as we can understand such things, there are (or at least can be seen) elements of the physical/material in the current heaven.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That, however,  raises an interesting conundrum.  The people going to heaven right now are
			dead, which means they are only spirits and  have no bodies.  How then can they interact with and enjoy a  physical heaven?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We saw scriptural evidence indicating that the current Heaven is a "physical" place and
			not just "spiritual" in the sense that nothing is solid or "real".  It makes sense that the Lord would adapt Heaven for our sensibilities and
			comfort since He needs no accommodation Himself.  But as we then thought of a logical problem.  The people going to Heaven are dead, which means
			they have no physical bodies, so ...</font></p>

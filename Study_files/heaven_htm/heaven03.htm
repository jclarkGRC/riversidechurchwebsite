			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 2: Will the current dwelling place of God, aka Heaven in the Bible, be the
				place where Christians will spend eternity?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This may seem an odd question. But I think it's important to get a proper understanding
				of heaven to start our journey.  When we start to consider concepts like "death" or "the afterlife" or "eternal destiny" there's a feeling
				of finality.  Rightly so, because each person's ultimate destination is determined at death.  The Bible does not teach "purgatory"
				(Catholicism) or "spirit prison" (Mormonism).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, that sense of finality has caused some to perhaps be mistaken about our ultimate
				destination.  Because we know that true believers go to "Heaven" and we know that "Heaven" is where the Father currently resides and that
				Jesus is at His right hand (<b>Acts 7:56</b>) and that it is our immediate destination when we die (<b>Philip. 1:21-23</b>) and we will
				always be with the Lord (<b>I Thess. 4:13-17</b>), therefore (some believe) the current place called "Heaven" must be our final and eternal
				destination and home.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But is that necessarily true?  If not, what is another possibility?  What if the Lord
				Himself moves on from the current "Heaven"?  Impossible?  Wait! Not so fast!  Take a look at <b>Revelation 21:1-3</b>! Hear what Randy Alcorn
				writes about this passage:
				<blockquote>
					Heaven, God's dwelling place, will one day  be on the New Earth.  Notice that the New Jerusalem, which <u>was</u> in Heaven, will come
					down out of Heaven from God.  Where does it go?  To the New Earth.  From that time on, "the dwelling of God" will be with redeemed
					mankind <u>on Earth</u>.  Some would argue that the New Earth shouldn't be called Heaven.  But it seems clear to me that if God's
					special dwelling place is by definition Heaven, and we're told that "the dwelling of God" will be with mankind on Earth, then Heaven
					and the New Earth will be essentially the same place. ... Again, it seems clear that wherever God dwells with his people and sits on
					his throne (<b>Revelation 22:1</b>) would be called Heaven. ... That God would come down to the New Earth to live with us fits perfectly
					with his original plan.  God could have taken Adam and Eve up to Heaven to visit with him in his world.  Instead, he came down to walk
					with them in their world (<b>Genesis 3:8</b>).  Jesus says of anyone who would be his disciple, "My Father will love him, and we will
					come to him and make our home with him" (<b><b>John 14:23</b></b>).  This is a picture of God's ultimate plan -- not to take us up to
					live in a realm made for him, but to come down and live with us in <u>the realm he made for us</u>.  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p.45,
					emphases his.)
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does this idea seem disappointing?  On the contrary it should excite us! Instead of
				looking ahead to being stuck on a cloud with only a harp for eternity (as some incorrectly paint the dreary picture) we can anticipate
				finally getting to explore this great, big and much improved world with no limits on our time, resources, abilities and friends (more on
				that later).</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So is it incorrect to say, "I'm a Christian bound for Heaven!"?  No, it's absolutely
					correct!  What is incorrect is the notion that the place we currently call Heaven, where God's throne is now, will be our home for
					eternity.  Think of it like an airline flight.  You have a final destination and when asked, you respond with that last stop.  It may
					be that you have a change of planes in another city and that may come up as you talk about the trip, but the layover is not the final
					destination upon which you are focused.  Just so, if we die before the Lord returns, we will have a layover in the place we will call
					the <b>intermediate Heaven</b>.  It's not permanent but neither is it unimportant because people we know are there now.  So we will
					next begin considering what we can about the intermediate Heaven. After that, we will turn our attention to the final destination.
					</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have seen that the Bible teaches that the final "Heaven" where we will spend
					eternity is actually the New Earth upon which the New Jerusalem will descend and where Jesus will reign forever.  The current "Heaven"
					where God the Father and Jesus are now dwelling is only a temporary place waiting until the Lord renews all things.  For the purposes
					of this study we are calling it the "Intermediate Heaven".  We will examine what the Bible teaches about this place since Christian
					people we know and love are there (and we ourselves as believers will also go there if Jesus tarries!).</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Back to: <a href="heaven09.htm">Question 8</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven11.htm">Question 10</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question #9: When God establishes the New Earth as our eternal home, will there
				still be space and time as we experience them now?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, we probably need to clarify what I mean by "space".  I do not mean "outer space"
				(i.e., the starry expanse beyond our earthly atmosphere).  Rather I am asking whether, in Heaven, we (and everything around us) will
				<b>occupy</b> space as we do now.  All physical, material objects require space in which to exist and move through.  Two separate objects
				cannot occupy the same space at the same time.  They will either repel each other from that space or one will move the other out of the
				space.  So will this still be true in eternity?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why do we ask this?  Once more it is because there are some misconceptions about Heaven
				and how we will relate to it.  A good ministry friend of mine once made the statement that in heaven we won't be subject to (or limited by)
				time or space.  This is a commonly held view based once more on the notion that we won't have physical bodies or characteristics.  Randy
				Alcorn shares:
				<blockquote>
					One author writes, "Only our redeemed spirits can live in a spiritual realm like heaven. Therefore, the life we know now as spiritual
					reality will continue in heaven, but we shall not need nor desire the things associated with our present physical bodies, simply because
					we shall not possess physical bodies in heaven." (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 460 citing Arthur Travis, <b><i>Where on Earth is Heaven?</i></b>)
				</blockquote>
				So, really, in asking the question about "space" we are once more asking about the reality of physical bodies in Heaven.  (I know, I know,
				we have already affirmed that we will have real bodies in Heaven.)  By answering the question about our bodies we answer the question
				about space.  If we have a real body we will need space to exist and to move through just as we do now.  The only alternatives would be:
				<ol>
					<li>
						We become disembodied spirits which we also already rejected based on scriptures like <b>Luke 24:36-43</b> and the concept of
						"death" equaling separation in the Bible.  If we do not have both body and spirit as God created us then we do not have "life"
						per se.
					</li>
					<li>
						 We are able to exist in more than one space (place) at once.
					</li>
				</ol>
				Once more Alcorn shares:
				<Blockquote>
					One writer says of Heaven, "It is certainly justifiable to abandon the scheme of time and space and to put in its place a divine
					simultaneity." This has a high-sounding resonance, but what does it mean?  That we can be in a thousand places at once doing ten
					thousand different things?  Those are the Creator's attributes, not the creature's.  There's no evidence that we could be several
					places at once.  The promise of Heaven is not that we will become infinite -- that would be to become inhuman.  It's that we will
					become far better finite humans than we have ever been.  Even if we're able to move rapidly from one place to another or to pass
					our resurrected molecules through solid objects as Jesus did, [Edit.: cf. <b>Luke 24:31, John 20:19</b>] we'll still be finite. ...
					There's no suggestion that even the resurrected Jesus was in two places at once. " (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 257.)
				</Blockquote>
				Now to the question of <b>time</b>. Some paint time as an enemy of mankind because we feel the very distressing constraints of time
				passing.  But time isn't our enemy -- the Curse/death is the real enemy which makes time our most precious commodity (but which so
				often we still manage to waste terribly).  But because of this idea, many think the passing of time must be eliminated for Heaven to
				be "good".  Often the KJV translation of <b>Rev. 10:6</b> is used to support this concept -- "<b>...should be time no longer</b>".
				But modern translations show the angel means no more delay before <b>"the mystery of God [is] finished"</b>. (<b>cf. 10:7</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alcorn cites the following Scriptures to show that time (or perhaps better, a
				progression or succession of events chronologically) is marked in Heaven: <b>Luke 15:7; Ephesians 2:7; Revelation 5:9-12; 6:10-11;
				7:15; 8:1; 22:2</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To sum up:  On p. 257 of <b><i>Heaven</i></b>, Alcorn paints the picture of fellowship
				in Heaven thusly, if we get together with friends, the question will still be "Where and when?" The "where" is space and the "when" is
				time.  It all goes back to what God created us to be.  As humans we will always need a frame of reference in which to exist (e.g. fish
				and water).  But no longer will we feel constrained by them.  No longer will we have to "number our days" (<b>Psalm 90:12</b>) or
				"redeem the time" (<b>Ephesians 5:16</b>) because no longer are we in danger of running out.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are still trying to discover as much as possible from God's word what our eternal
				home will be like.  We have talked about some things that will stay the same (e.g., we will function within a framework of space and
				time; many features we now see on the earth will likely also be on the New Earth).  Now let's turn our attention to the great city
				which the Lord is preparing for us even now.

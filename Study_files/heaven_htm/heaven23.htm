			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Back to: <a href="heaven22.htm">Question 21</a></b></font></p>
			<!--<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven24.htm">Question</a></b></font></p>-->
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 22: How should the knowledge and insight we have gained from God's Word
				about Heaven affect our lives right now?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To begin try to think of the most striking or most helpful truth this study has revealed
				to you.  For myself, there has been instilled a new sense of reality about the whole thing.  To become conscious of the fact that it will
				be the <b>real</b> me (cf. <b>Job 19:26-27</b>) in a <b>real</b> place called the New Earth along with others to whom I will relate to and
				enjoy.  We will have <b>real</b> purposes, tasks, opportunities and adventures but without the limitations of time and resources, without
				weakness and suffering, without death and evil.  Those thoughts have helped me especially with regard to having a proper perspective about
				the here and now, and that is the subject of our question.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are three broad areas where most of us could probably use some help as we live out
				our lives in this present world.  One of them has to do with our <b>attachments</b>.  What do I mean by that?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of us have feelings of fondness for the things which we feel are important to our
				quality of life.  I am thinking chiefly of possessions and wealth.  <b>But</b> if I reorient myself to viewing the kingdom of God on the
				New Earth as my true "forever" home, rather than my current situation, what should then happen?  The things of this world which I control
				and have in my possession, I will hold more loosely.  I will not be obsessed with those things which will one day be consumed by fire
				(cf. <b>II Peter 3:10-13</b>).  I will not be overcome by materialism but will be more interested in investing in that "forever" home
				which the Lord is preparing for us.  Jesus taught this truth clearly (cf. <b>Matthew 6:19-21</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's balance that a little.  Does that mean we should then be careless or irresponsible
				with the resources God has placed in our hands?  That we should place no value at all on the things of this present world?  No.  He made
				these things for us to use so that we can live and work and enjoy life even now.  And we have a responsibility to be good stewards of what
				we possess.  It is wise to make sure we can take care of ourselves and be able to help others financially and give generously to God's
				kingdom.  So we are not saying that to see Heaven as our eternal home means to disregard and dismiss our financial responsibilities.
				Yet we should be aware that all these things <b>will</b> pass away and be replaced with <b>better</b> things some day.  Knowing that and
				believing it will mean the material possessions we have and the wealth we accumulate and the pleasures we currently experience will never
				become the <b>reason</b> we live nor the <b>focus</b> of our lives.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Randy Alcorn speaks well and a little more broadly to this issue:
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Following Christ is not a call to abstain from gratification but to delay gratification.  It's finding joy in Christ rather than
					seeking joy in the things of this world.  Heaven -- our assurance of eternal gratification and fulfillment -- should be our North
					Star, reminding us where we are and which direction to go.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we realize the pleasures that await us in God's presence, we can forgo lesser pleasures now.  When we realize the possessions
					that await us in Heaven, we will gladly give away possessions on Earth to store up treasures in Heaven.  When we realize the power
					offered to us as rulers in God's Kingdom, a power we could not handle now but will handle with humility and benevolence then, we can
					forgo the pursuit of power here.
				</p>
				<p>
					 To be Heaven-oriented is to be goal-oriented in the best sense.  Paul says, "But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and
					 straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus
					 (<b>Philippians 3:13-14</b>).
				</p>
				<p>
					(<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 455.)
				</p>

			</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having focused on the idea that truly believing in Heaven as our "forever" home will
			help us in our <b>attachments</b>, we have noted that properly relating to our wealth and possessions and resisting the lure of materialism
			gives us the proper understanding that all these things will pass away except what we store up for ourselves in Heaven, which will be ours
			forever.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second broad area in our lives which will be helped by a proper realization of the
				truth of Heaven has to do with our <b>attitudes</b>.  Let's consider a couple of areas where our attitudes should be changed for the
				better because we believe God's word about Heaven.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Outlook in general.</b>  Knowing that whatever trouble I may have to endure now is temporary and that endless joy and
							pleasure await me in God's kingdom should help me have an overall positive perspective about life.  Christians who think
							seriously about Heaven should be, in general, optimists.  Let's balance that a little.  I'm not endorsing a forced, phony,
							smile at everything pseudo-happiness.  Even Christians have bad days.  You will occasionally suffer a profound loss or
							disappointment.
						</p>
						<p>
							You will experience sorrow.  These emotions are valid and the  expression of them is normal -- cf. <b>David, Job, Jesus</b>.
							But the underlying hope of Heaven helps you endure. Understanding that evil and suffering will pass and that redemption,
							justice,  righteousness, and glory awaits is absolutely encouraging -- cf. <b>Acts 16:22-25</b>.  Randy Alcorn writes:
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									Secular optimists are wishful thinkers.  Discovering the present payoffs of optimism, they conduct seminars and write
									books on thinking positively. Sometimes they capitalize on optimism by becoming rich and famous.  But then what
									happens?  They eventually get old or sick, and when they die they go to Hell forever.  Their optimism is an illusion,
									for it fails to take eternity into account.
								</p>
								<p>
									The only proper foundation for optimism is the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.  Any other foundation is sand, not
									rock.  It will not bear the weight of our eternity.
								</p>
								<p>
									However if we build our lives on the redemptive work of Christ, we should all be optimists.  Why?  Because even the
									most painful experience in life is but a temporary setback.  Our pain and suffering may or may not be relieved in this
									life, but they will <i>certainly</i> be relieved in the next. ... No Christian should be a pessimist.  We should be
									realists -- focused on the <i>reality</i> that we serve a sovereign and gracious God.  Because of the <i>reality</i>
									of Christ's atoning sacrifice and His promises, biblical realism is <i>optimism</i>. (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 443-44.)
								</p>
							</blockquote>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Death</b>.  Because most people have invested almost everything into this life and this world, when it comes time to leave,
							death is seen as an awful, terrible ordeal with nothing good attached.
						</p>
						<p>
							This can even be true of professing believers.  One minister said that often at prayer meetings, we spend more time and energy
							praying for God to keep Christians out of heaven than sinners out of hell.  But understanding the true nature of what comes
							next changes how we see death.  From Alcorn's book <b><i>Heaven</i></b>:
							<blockquote>
								<p>
								Imagine someone takes you to a party. ... The party's all right, but you keep hoping it will get better. ... Suddenly, your
								friend says, "I need to take you home."
								</p>
								<p>
									Now?
								</p>
								<p>
									You're disappointed -- nobody wants to leave a party early -- but you leave, and your friend drops you off at your house.
									... you open the door ... flip on the light.
								</p>
								<p>
									"Surprise!"  Your house is full of smiling people, familiar faces.
								</p>
								<p>
									It's a party --- for <i>you</i>! ... The tables are full. ... You recognize the guests, people you haven't seen for a long
									time.  Then, one by one, the people you most enjoyed at the other party show up at your house, grinning.   This turns out
									to be the <i>real</i> party.  You realize that if you'd stayed longer at the other party, as you'd wanted, you wouldn't
									be <i>at</i> the real party -- you'd be <i>away</i> from it.
								</p>
								<p>
									Christians faced with terminal illnesses or imminent death often feel they're leaving the party before it's over. They
									have to go home early.  They're disappointed, thinking of all they'll miss when they leave.  But the truth is, the real
									party is underway at home -- precisely where they're going.  They're not the ones missing the party; those of us left
									behind are. (Fortunately, if we know Jesus, we'll get there eventually.) (<b><i>p. 441</i></b>) ...
								</p>
								<p>
									We see life differently when we realize that death isn't a wall but a turnstile; a small obstacle that marks a great
									beginning. (<b><i>p. 447</i></b>)
								</p>
								<p>
									We acknowledge that death is part of the Fall and the Curse. It is a sorrowful and painful event.  It is not wrong to
									be sad and mourn our separation from a loved one.  But as believers we should not mourn as those who have no hope
									-- cf. <b>I Thessalonians 4:13</b>. We will see our loved ones in Christ again!
								</p>
							</blockquote>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We now come to the third broad area affected by the knowledge of Heaven. We have seen that
				in light of our beliefs about Heaven as revealed in the Bible, our <b>attachments</b> and our <b>attitudes </b>should be affected. Regarding
				attachments, we should hold less tightly to our temporary earthly possessions and instead invest in the eternal treasures of God's kingdom.
				And, regarding attitudes, we should be generally positive in our demeanor since we know whatever negative situations we may face now are
				temporary.  Also, the thought of death should not terrify we who are in Christ because we know it is the door though which we pass so as to
				experience better things.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third broad area of our lives which should be affected by our understanding of Heaven
				is our <b>activities</b>.  Because if we do want to lay up treasures in Heaven as Jesus advised in <b>Matthew 6:20</b> it means that we must
				invest time, energy and resources into His kingdom (cf. Matthew 25:19-21ff). It is important to make this a priority because our chance to
				do so is limited. Consider Randy Alcorn's thoughts on this matter:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						We'll have eternity to celebrate great victories on the old Earth, but we have only this brief window of opportunity now to win
						those victories.  As missionary C.T. Studd said, "Only one life, 'twill soon be past; only what's done for Christ will last."
					</p>
					<p>
						What will last for eternity?  Not your car, house, degrees, trophies, or business.  What <i>will</i> last for eternity is every
						service to the needy, every dollar given to feed the hungry, every cup of cold water given to the thirsty, every investment in
						missions, every prayer for the needy, every effort invested in evangelism, and every moment spent caring for the precious
						children -- including rocking them to sleep and changing their diapers.  The Bible says we'll reap in eternity what we've planted
						in this life (<b>Galatians:6:7-8</b>). ...
					</p>
					<p>
						Ask yourself these questions:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Do I daily reflect on my own mortality?
							</li>
							<li>
								Do I daily realize that there are only two destinations -- Heaven or Hell -- and that I and every person I know will go to
								one or the other?
							</li>
							<li>
								Do I daily remind myself that this world is not my home and that everything in it will burn, leaving behind only what's
								eternal?
							</li>
							<li>
								Do I daily recognize that my choices and actions have a direct influence on the world to come?
							</li>
							<li>
								Do I daily realize that my life is being examined by God, the Audience of One. and that the only appraisal of my life that
								will ultimately matter is His?
							</li>
						</ul>
						(<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 453-54.) ...
					</p>
					<p>
						Heaven should affect our activities and ambitions, our recreation and friendships, and the way we spend our money and time.  If
						I believe I'll spend eternity in a world of unending beauty and adventure, will I be content to spend all my evenings staring at
						game shows, sitcom and ball games?  Even if I keep my eyes off of impurities, how much time will I want to invest in what doesn't
						matter?
					</p>
					<p>
						What will last forever?  God's Word.  People.  Spending time in God's Word and investing in people will pay off in eternity and
						bring me joy and perspective now.  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 455.)
					</p>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Powerful thoughts and words.  Truly believing what we have seen from God's word about
				Heaven should have a profound effect on us in all parts of our lives.  Does this mean I never take a moment for myself or enjoy a light
				moment or watch a show just for enjoyment?  Does it mean I can never "waste" a minute of time?  No.  I don't think God wants us to
				experience a huge guilt trip every time we do something we enjoy simply for fun.  Maybe we can think of it like our jobs.  We are there
				being paid to accomplish a task.  But does that mean every second is always productive?  Do we never take a break or stop for a second
				or two to banter with a colleague or never get sidetracked? No,  that's all expected as part of human social behavior.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what if I clocked in and never worked and always did my own thing?  Then there would
				be a problem.  Just so God allows us to be human and to enjoy life <b>but</b> when it becomes all about us and our desires so that we
				forget about Him and our place as His servants, there's a problem (for which we will be held accountable -- cf. <b>Matthew 25:24-30</b>)
				and we most definitely need to re-evaluate our priorities.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To bring this all to a conclusion I will present a final excerpt from pages 456-57 of
				Randy Alcorn's book <b><i>Heaven</i></b>.
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Nanci and I have spent some wonderful moments with our family and friends -- at Christmas or on vacation or at simple times in the
						family room after dinner -- and we've had those enchanting words: "It doesn't get any better than this."
					</p>
					<p>
						No matter how difficult life has been, you've said the same thing about some magnificent moment, haven't you?  Maybe it was
						recently. Maybe it was long ago. Maybe you can barely remember. "It doesn't get any better than this." Can you think of even one
						time in your life when, even for a fleeting moment, that seemed to be true?
					</p>
					<p>
						Well, it <i>isn't</i> true.
					</p>
					<p>
						The most ordinary moment on the New Earth will be greater than the most perfect moment in this life -- those experiences you wanted
						to bottle or hang on to but couldn't. It <i>can</i> get better, far better, than this -- <i>and it will</i>. Life on the New
						<br>Earth will be like sitting in front of the fire with family and friends, basking in the warmth, laughing uproariously, dreaming
						of the adventures to come -- and then going out and <i>living</i> those adventures together.  With no fear that life will ever
						end or that tragedy will descend like a dark cloud. With no fear that dreams will be shattered or relationships broken.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the ideas presented in this book were merely the product of my imagination, they would be meaningless.  But here's what the
						apostle John recorded near the end of the Bible:
						<blockquote>
							Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth ... And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God is with
							men, and he will live with them.  They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.  He will wipe
							every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things is passed
							away." He who was seated on the throne said, "I am making everything new!" Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are
							trustworthy and true." (<b>Revelation 21:1, 3-5</b>)
						</blockquote>
						These are the words of King Jesus. Count on them. Take them to the bank. Live every day in light of them. Make every choice in light
						of Christ's certain promise.
					</p>
					<p>
						We were all made for a person and a place. Jesus is the person. Heaven is the place.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you know Jesus, I'll be with you in that resurrected world. With the Lord we love and with the friends we cherish, we'll embark
						together on the ultimate adventure, in a spectacular new universe awaiting our exploration and domination. Jesus will be the center
						of all things, and joy will be the air we breathe.
					</p>
					<p>
						And right when you think "it doesn't get any better than this" -- <i>it will</i>.
					</p>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I hope this study has been thought provoking and profitable for you.  Once more I highly
				recommend buying or borrowing Alcorn's book to read for yourself.  There is much more detail and information than what we could cover in
				this "brief" study.  I look forward to seeing and fellowshipping with you all one day in that wonderful new home we will share in God's
				kingdom on the New Earth!

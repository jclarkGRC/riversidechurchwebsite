			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven07.htm">Question 6</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 5: What do those presently dwelling in the intermediate Heaven
				experience?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obviously, we cannot know specific individual experiences of any who have passed away.
				And, until arriving ourselves, we will never fully grasp what Heaven holds in store for us.  In the last question we briefly considered
				some implications from Jesus' story of the rich man and Lazarus which included truly experiencing and feeling comfort, pain, heat (and
				perhaps thirst), regret, concern, etc.  These things are familiar to us.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, could Jesus have told the story in such a way so it made sense to His listeners
				(i.e., not a lie but similar to ascribing human characteristics to God)?  It's possible.  In fact some think the story is only a parable
				and not based on real people.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we concede that what we are discussing is speculative.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So let's go whole hog and consider another questionable passage with regard to this kind
				of inquiry -- <b>Revelation 6:9-11</b>.
				<blockquote>
					NOTE: Please understand, it is not questionable because it is incorrect or it might not be part of God's true Word.  We believe it is
					absolutely part of God's word and therefore absolutely correct in all ways.  The question comes because, as we have already stated,
					John's book is apocalyptic in nature and contains much figurative language.  So does this passage intend to reveal to us what's going
					on in Heaven or is there some other meaning hidden in the Fifth Seal being broken? It's a fair question and we cannot know for sure.
					For now, let's assume the passage does give a glimpse of the state of things with those who are currently in Heaven as John looks on.
					What can we deduce?  Several things.  But first, let me once more acknowledge Randy Alcorn's book <b><i>Heaven</i></b> (pp. 65-73)
					for most of the following thoughts.
				</blockquote>
				The phrase "those who had been slain" indicates a direct continuity between who they were on earth (personal history) and who they are now
				in Heaven.  Asking the Lord to "avenge our blood"  shows they remember their lives on earth.  We do not lose our individual identities.
				This is further confirmed by the fact that "a white robe was given to <u>each</u> of them".</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That they "called out in a loud voice" shows audible expression implying physical form
				(ditto the "robes") a la our last question's conclusions.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The volume of their cry suggests emotion or passion so we will still have feelings then
				as we do now.  That they <u>knew when</u> to be passionate indicates rationality, and that they cried out together reveals unity and
				agreement.  Heaven is populated with right minded and like minded people who love God, acknowledge Him as Lord and King, and hate evil
				and injustice.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That they are inquiring of the Lord shows that they can and do communicate with Him.
				Do they pray?  Why not?  Given their concern for their loved ones (<b>Luke 16:27-28</b>) it makes perfect sense.  But that does not mean
				we are justified in praying to saints as Roman Catholics do.  We are all in the same boat ("fellow servants and brothers") and should all
				pray directly to the Lord Himself and never to other humans (<b>Hebrews 4:14-16</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They know that, so far, their blood is <u>not</u> avenged, which implies that they do
				have some knowledge of events on earth.  Can they somehow see what's happening there?  Based on <b>I Samuel 28:16-19</b>;
				<b>Luke 9:30-31</b>; and <b>Hebrews 12:1</b>, some believe so.  Or maybe they receive the information another way but, regardless of how
				it happens, there's a strong indication that people in Heaven are very concerned with the activities of people on earth.
				<blockquote>
					NOTE:  In a way it might be said that those in the intermediate Heaven are still affected and coexist with the issues of Adam's fall
					and the curse.  Certainly that is true if we remember that death has separated their spirits from their bodies and has not been
					permanently corrected yet.   How can this be?  Wouldn't that prevent Heaven from being Heaven?  We don't expect to be sad or affected
					by sin in Heaven, do we?  But remember the promise that all the bad things have "passed away" (<b>Revelation 21:4</b>) comes only
					<u>after</u> the creation of the New Earth, our <u>eternal</u> Heaven and home.  I believe the intermediate Heaven is a far better
					and happier place than our current earth (e.g., Lazarus) but there is no Scriptural promise that there <u>is no sorrow at all</u>
					there.  Especially if they can see and know current affairs on earth and what's happening with their loved ones.  But neither is it
					always dreary -- they see God at work and the spiritual victories, too.  Further in their question we see they obviously do not have
					all the available information.  It may very well be that we will obtain more knowledge upon arriving in Heaven, but it seems we will
					still have things to learn and discover even after our arrival.  And some things the Lord may withhold from us in His wisdom and mercy
					until we are ready.
				</blockquote>
				The question "How long? ... " and the answer that "they should rest a little while longer ... " implies that there is an ongoing progression
				of events.  The term "time" may mean something different to those in Heaven than to us, but existence and forward movement is still measured
				somehow.  These martyrs are looking forward to something yet to come in their own future.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the exception of being physically dead, it seems like in the intermediate Heaven, we
			continue to be what God made us to be--human beings!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have looked at some clues from the Bible about what the current inhabitants of the
				intermediate Heaven might be now experiencing.  One notable item we realized is that in some ways they are still affected by sin and the
				curse (e.g., separated from their bodies in death, sadness from knowledge of events on earth).  But God has promised that this will not
				always be the case (<b>Rev. 21:4</b>). So with that thought let's turn from looking at the intermediate Heaven (ultimately a waiting place)
				to the eternal Heaven (our forever home) and see what we can find out about it.  In Question 2 we established that what we call "Heaven"
				will not actually be "somewhere out there" but in fact we will make our eternal home on the New Earth (which is also where the New
				Jerusalem and our Lord Jesus will be as well -- <b>Rev. 21:1-3</b>).  So in light of that...</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 12: When we finally enter Heaven, will we still be ourselves in personality
				and emotions?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOTE:  You may have noticed in that second misconception of losing one's personal identity
				which we have seen, there were no scripture references used to establish the truth.  The reason for that was avoiding  redundancy (I know, I
				know, it's too late for that in this study!).  We will be using the same passages I would have used in that section to answer the main
				question here.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To begin addressing that, we probably need to ask another question:  "What makes
				you ... you?" In his book <b><i>Heaven</i></b>, Randy Alcorn answers that question by saying:
				<blockquote>
					It's not only your body but also your memory, personality, traits, gifts, passions, preferences, and interests. (p. 274)  This is true
					in that while twins can be almost identical in appearance,  at times they can be almost opposite in personality.
				</blockquote>
				So do these things about us which make us unique individuals continue in Heaven?  We'll focus for now on some non-material aspects and come
				back next time to discuss our bodies.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Names.</b>  The first thing that happens when you begin a transaction is the request
				for your name. It's a major part of identifying who you are.  Names are also important in the Bible in this regard (e.g., Abram was changed
				to Abraham, Sarai to Sarah, and Jacob to Israel to reflect important changes in their identities--cf. <b>Gen. 17, 32</b>).  So are there
				still names in Heaven?  Consider the following passages:  <b>Matt. 8:11; Luke 16:22-24; Rev. 3:5; 21:12, 14</b>.  Do the names of Abraham,
				etc., refer to the people recorded in the Bible?  Are the names written in the Book of Life in reference to real people?  These rhetorical
				questions serve to show that the continued use of earthly names reflect a continuation of personal identity from earth into Heaven.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what about <b>Revelation 2:17, 3:12</b>?  Do these new names indicate a drastic
				change in identity so we become unrecognizable?  I don't think so.  Receiving a new name does not invalidate the old one -- did you notice
				Jesus still referred to "Jacob" even though he was renamed "Israel"?  Or did Jesus calling Simon "Peter" remove the first name?  The new
				names given us may be God's name for us or an additional identification, but it seems to me they would not change the person we are, but
				rather would reflect who we are more plainly.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Personality.</b>  The concept of personality is complex but, when we try to describe
				someone, we often refer to their  emotions (e.g., "quiet and calm", "loud and boisterous", etc.).  So will there be emotions in heaven?
				Consider:  <b>Luke 6:21; 15:25; Rev. 6:9-10; 7:9-17; 21:4</b>.  It seems people in Heaven continue to have emotional responses to events
				around them.  If that's true it follows that, as individuals, we will continue to respond in the way God created us with our unique
				personalities (great excitement, or less; with fiery passion, or with cool calmness; and many degrees between!).  The great thing is that
				in Heaven we will never have to worry our emotions might "betray" us, reveal "weakness" in us, or lead us down wrong paths.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Desires.</b>  We earlier have touched on the fact that maybe we will "need" to eat
				just as Adam and Eve did even though they were originally created to live forever. If that will be true of us physically, it is logical
				that we will have other kinds of needs or desires in Heaven as well. I think we'll still be curious about the universe; we'll want to
				experience new things; we'll wish to travel/explore -- I mean eternity is a long time, it'll get boring in short order with nothing new
				to do.  Certainly we will be given responsibilities according to our gifts and efforts -- cf. <b>Matt. 25:14ff; Luke 19:11ff</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point here is that in an infinite universe, unique individuals will have diverse
				interests and pursue different objectives with varying degrees of passion.  That is also part of what makes you ... you!  We all have
				distinctly different interests and desires and that will likely carry over into Heaven. That doesn't mean you can't develop new interests
				-- that happens even now.  But there may be things that never appeal to you because of who you are!  But again the great thing is that
				your desires in Heaven will always be appropriately within the scope of God's will!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Randy Alcorn speaks to the fact that we will still be "us".
				<blockquote>
					<p>You will be <i>you</i> in Heaven.  Who else would you be? If Bob, a man on Earth, is no longer Bob when he gets to Heaven, then, in
						fact, Bob did not go to Heaven. If when I arrive in Heaven, I'm not the same person with the same identity, history, and memory,
						then <i>I</i> didn't go to Heaven. </p>
					<p>
						The resurrected Jesus did not become someone else; he remained who he was before his resurrection. "It is I, myself!"
						(<b>Luke 24:39</b>). In John's Gospel, Jesus deals with Mary, Thomas, and Peter in very personal ways, drawing on his previous
						knowledge of them (<b>Jphn 20: 10-18, 24-29;21:15-22</b>).His knowledge and relationships from his pre-resurected state carried
						over. When Thomas said, "My Lord and my God", he knew he was speaking to the same Jesus he'd followed. When John said, "It is
						the Lord", he meant, "It's really him -- the Jesus we have known" (<b>John 21:4-7</b>).
					</p>
					<p>
						If we weren't ourselves in the afterlife, the we couldn't be held accountable for what we did in this life.  The Judgement would
						be meaningless. If Barbara is no longer Barbara, she can't be rewarded or held accountable for anything Barbara did. She'd have to
						say, "But that wasn't me". The doctrines of judgement and eternal rewards depend on people's retaining their distinct identities
						from this life to the next. (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 278-79)
					</p>
				</blockquote>There are two important concepts to remember regarding the concept of keeping our personal identities:  the necessity of
				continuity and the Lord's delight in diversity!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having discussed the continuation of our individual human personalities (that immaterial
				part which makes you ... you) into the kingdom of heaven, let's transition and talk about the other part of us which also has an enormous
				influence on who we are as individuals.  Of course I am referring to our bodies.  We have already discussed extensively that our eternal
				home will be a real, physical, material place, that God created humans with both material and immaterial features (body and spirit) and,
				it follows, this situation will continue in Heaven.  But many may wonder ...

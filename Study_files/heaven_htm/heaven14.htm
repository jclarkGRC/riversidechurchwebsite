			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven15.htm">Question 14</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 13: When we enter the kingdom of Heaven, what will our bodies be like?
				</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a question which is extremely intriguing and complex so we will split it into
				sub-questions in order to obtain better clarity regarding the main issues which usually concern us as human beings when it comes to our
				bodies.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>In Heaven, will everyone one be "beautiful", or in other words, will all who are there
				possess physical perfection?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is an interesting question because almost everyone would change something about
				their looks or their bodies if given a chance.  And what they would do is bring their looks/body more into conformity with current cultural
				ideals about beauty. (Hence the popularity of cosmetics, diet plans, fashion, health/exercise clubs, plastic surgery, etc.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, as the saying goes, "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."  Cultural ideals change
				and vary widely.  Some have trumpeted thinness while others glorify plumpness.  Some think deeply tanned or dark skin is more desirable
				while others crave lighter or fairer skin. I think it is safe to draw three logical conclusions about our eternal looks from what we know
				about God:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Since when the Lord makes something (or in this case remakes our bodies) it is always 'good,' it is reasonable to assume our
						bodies will have perfect health and, thus, healthy proportions.  This sort of vibrant wellbeing and strength will, in and of
						itself, be beautiful.  Even now in a fallen creation, it can be said that someone has a natural glow of beauty stemming from
						good health.  Yet the most beautiful, healthy person you know right now is still under the Curse and is the "weak and diseased
						remains of the original bodies God made for humans." (Alcorn, <b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 281.)  Imagine what it will be like in
						a restored universe with no deformity, defect, nor decrepitude.  Our current models of beauty (pun intended) will pale in
						comparison to what we'll see there.
					</li>
					<li>
						We have noted God's creativity and affinity for tremendous diversity.  This almost certainly means that we will not all be exactly
						alike in our body types, with all men looking like a superhero and all women like a Miss Universe contestant.  The idea of healthy
						proportions can include many different kinds of body types.  Likewise the concept of continuity (we will still be ourselves when we
						go to Heaven) implies that we will be similar in eternity.  If you are tall and slender or short and stout, or whatever, it is
						reasonable to think you will still be identifiable in that way.  But, obviously, not to unhealthy extremes.
					</li>
					<li>
						While it may be that some of the things you do not like about yourself will be changed (certainly we would expect deformities and
						handicaps to be removed), it may well be that the thing that really changes is our attitudes.  Most likely our new, sinless nature
						will result in us not being so preoccupied and concerned about outer beauty and our own appearances.  Randy Alcorn speaks to this
						when he writes the following in his book Heaven:
						<blockquote>
							Most people aren't longing so much for a perfect body as for the sense of well-being and approval they think goes with it.
							Of this we can be certain -- no matter what we look like, our bodies will please the Lord, ourselves, and others.  We won't gaze
							into the mirror wishing for a different nose or different cheeks, ears or teeth.  The sinless beauty of the inner person will
							overflow into the beauty of the outer person.  We'll feel neither insecurity nor arrogance.  We won't attempt to hide or impress.
							We won't have to <u>try</u> to look beautiful -- we <u>will</u> be beautiful.  We'll be most grateful, not about our appearance,
							but for our health and strength.  We'll know the Artist fashioned us just as he desired and that we'll never lose the health
							and beauty he's graciously given us.  (p. 282; emphases his.)
						</blockquote>
					</li>
				</ul>
				The first of our sub-questions concerns whether in the New Earth (or Heaven) we will all have bodies considered perfect and "beautiful."
				The next sub-question is:</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Will our bodies have new abilities and senses?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First let's think about our senses.  Right now we all (barring handicaps) have five
				senses: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touch.  We expect this to continue because we saw that Jesus' body continued to function
				as it did before His resurrection.  He recognized people so we assume He saw them, He responded to people so He could hear, He ate fish
				and honeycomb so presumably He smelled and tasted it, He handled things so it seems the sense of touch was there.  So we expect our senses
				to continue -- and most likely better than before.  Certainly we expect the need for any aids we may use (e.g., hearing, eyeglasses, etc.)
				to be eliminated and we probably think our "normal" senses will be improved some.  But beyond those things, let's speculate a little.
				Could some of our senses be enhanced beyond what we now think of as "normal"?  Can you think of any possible cool upgrades you would like
				to get?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What about seeing in infrared, ultraviolet or having night vision?  Some animals/insects
				can.  We understand that there are times when we cannot sense supernatural beings around us (angels/demons).  Will we always be able to
				see and hear them with our new senses or must they still choose to reveal themselves first?  What about hearing with the sensitivity of a
				bat which uses sound as sonar?  What about smelling with the sensitivity of a hound or a shark which can smell (taste?) blood miles away?
				Some of these seem possible because we can already see them in nature.  What about something more radical like having control over your
				eyes so you can refocus them to be like telescopes or microscopes to better explore God's creation?  That sort of leads us to the idea of
				brand new senses -- the 'sixth sense' or maybe more?  What else could God give us?  I don't know.  How do you describe something you've
				never experienced?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What about new physical abilities?  Well, to start, one amazing thing is that we will
				never face the dilemma confronting the disciples in Gethsemane where Jesus told His disciples, "The spirit is willing, but the body is
				weak." (cf. <b>Matthew 26:41</b>)
				<blockquote>
					NOTE:  I heard a professional athlete once comment that after several years of playing his game, while he had a lot of experience and
					a much better knowledge of how to play and what to do, he found that his body could no longer do the things his mind was telling it to
					do.  It had deteriorated.  That will not happen in the New Earth.  Alcorn comments that, "We should anticipate an unprecedented harmony
					of mind and body."
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some believe that since Jesus suddenly appeared, apparently through walls
				(cf. <b>John 20:19</b>), and disappeared (cf. <b>Luke 24:31</b>), and defied gravity (cf. <b>Acts 1:9</b>), that we will be able to do
				these things as well since we will be "like Him" (cf. <b>I John 3:2</b>). I have my doubts about some of that. It's possible (probable)
				that Jesus' body can do things we will not be able to do because He is also God the Son.  I am more inclined to think we will continue
				to be subject to the laws of physics. But again, we do not know.  God can grant whatever gifts He wants.  But perhaps more likely, we will
				be able to do things we do now but in a much more powerful way.  For instance, maybe we'll be able to run like cheetahs, climb like monkeys,
				swim like fish or deep dive in the water like whales do now, and so on.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have a lot to look forward to -- I can't wait to taste the food!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have considered the idea that perhaps in Heaven we will have enhanced senses and
				perhaps even new abilities given to our new and improved bodies.  We will continue with our sub-questions ...</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Will we still be male and female in Heaven?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some cite <b>Galatians 3:28</b> to respond in the negative and suppose that this may
				be the reason that Jesus said what He did in <b>Matthew 22:29-30</b>.  But is this sound interpretation?  The context of Paul's statement
				was equal standing in Christ for all believers no matter what the circumstances of anyone's birth might be.  All are equal and joint
				heirs of God's promises (cf. <b>Gal. 3:29</b>).  Furthermore if we look at Paul's words, he is saying we "are one in Christ Jesus"
				meaning right now!  Have we ceased being male and female? No.  Also Jesus did not say why men and women are not given in marriage in
				the Kingdom, though many think the current institution is overshadowed and fulfilled in the marriage of the church as the bride of
				Christ to the Lord (cf. <b>Rev. 19:7-9</b>).  So we see that these verses really do not apply to the question though some have used
				them in that fashion.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But perhaps we can settle this by making some observations. When those who had
				previously died were seen by those still alive in the Bible (e.g. Samuel -- <b>I Sam. 28:14</b>, Moses and Elijah -- <b>Matt. 17:1-4</b>),
				they were recognized and named.  That implies that they retained their gender because if someone dresses as (or changes into) the opposite
				gender, it is often hard to recognize them.  Also consider Jesus who was resurrected and interacted with them.  Is He not still a man?
				According to all the personal pronouns referring to Him, yes (cf. <b>Acts 1:9-11</b>).  Finally, remember the principle of continuity.
				Being male or female is a fundamental, essential element to your personal identity.  If that is stripped away, could it be said that we
				(you yourself or I myself) actually went to Heaven?  Since we expect that it is ourselves who will be in Heaven, it is logical that we
				will still be who we are, including our gender.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We concluded our discussion of whether we would still be male and female by noting that
				our gender is a fundamental piece of our personal identity and it seems unlikely that the Lord will strip that away. But speaking of
				stripping something away, the next sub-question is ...</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Will we wear clothes in heaven?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is an interesting question because we have suggested that in order to get a more
				accurate idea of what life in the New Earth (or Heaven) will be like, it may be helpful to compare it to the original setting in Eden
				that God prepared for Adam and Eve.  But in doing that we see in <b>Genesis 2:25</b> that <b>"they were both naked, the man and his wife,
				and they were not ashamed." </b> Most assume this points to their innocence before the fall (i.e., their sin) and since we, after being
				resurrected, will no longer have a sin nature, maybe we will resume a state of complete innocence and, therefore, no longer need to wear
				clothing.  That may be hard to envision, but we should not reject an idea simply because it is difficult to imagine.  I think there are
				many things that, if God were to reveal them right now, may be hard  to visualize and accept about Heaven.  If being unclothed in Heaven
				is what God intends, then of course it would be proper no matter how uncomfortable we may feel about it right now.  However there are
				some other thoughts about that passage and the situation in Eden which, if true, may give us hope that running about in the buff will
				not be the case there.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One preliminary thought is that maybe the relationship of them being man and wife may
				have contributed to the lack of shame.  However, in light of <b>Genesis 3:7</b>, that does not seem to be the case.  Their shamelessness
				is attributed to a childlike innocence or ignorance about the very concept of nakedness.  It was not that they did not mind being naked
				in front of each other, it was that they did not even realize they were naked before they ate the fruit.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But that leads to another thought.  Here's a question: "What was it that opened their
				eyes -- was it the sin of disobeying God or was the effect of the fruit on them?"  I will suggest that while their sin brought about the
				curse and death, it was the fruit of the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (<b>Gen. 2:17</b>) which opened their eyes (or else
				why would God call the tree by that name?).  But what does this have to do with the price of rice in China?  Well, remember that when
				God finished His creation everything was "good" (<b>Gen 1:31</b>).  This would include the tree of knowledge.  Which implies the tree
				would indeed serve a good purpose ... eventually.  The point is that if the tree was good, it seems the only logical reason for God to
				withhold it from them is that it was just not the proper time yet for them to have it.  If that's true (and of course this is speculative),
				it stands to reason that eventually they would be allowed to eat the fruit resulting in their eyes then being opened to the fact that
				they were naked.  Having such knowledge at that point would not be wrong or evil.  It was not gaining the knowledge, per se, that was
				evil, rather it was the illegitimate way and why they obtained it.  And if all this is true (again, unknowable now), it is also logical
				that Adam and Eve would have eventually begun to wear clothes even though sinless.  They would have lost their innocence in the sense of
				being childlike (i.e., now they comprehend nudity) but not in the sense of moral perfection.  What am I saying?  Only that when God
				restores our moral perfection (takes away our sin nature) it does not seem very likely that He will, at the same time, take away our
				knowledge and make us childlike again so that we have no hesitation running around in our birthday suits.  My opinion.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But if you don't buy all that speculation and reasoning, there's always
				<b>Revelation 3:4</b> and <b>6:11</b> which indicate, at the very least, the idea that clothes are used in Heaven.  In
				<b>Revelation 19:13</b> we see that Jesus Himself is clothed.  It seems to me that we will be wearing clothes in Heaven.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having finished discussing (and largely speculating upon) the issue of whether we will
				wear clothes in Heaven on the New Earth, we will continue this series of sub-questions with ...</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What age/state of maturity will we be in Heaven?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have discussed this somewhat (though I've tried to prevent it from happening before
				we finally got here) and we have, more or less, concluded that we will be at that "perfect age."</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what exactly is that "perfect age?"  Randy Alcorn cites some theologians past and
				present who, more or less, are in agreement:
				<blockquote>
					Alister McGrath states, "By the late thirteenth century, the church's emerging consensus was this: As each person reaches their peak
					of perfection around the age of 30, they will be resurrected, as they would have appeared  at that time -- even if they never lived
					to reach that age."  Thomas Aquinas, the great medieval theologian, argued that we will all be the age of Christ when he was crucified,
					about thirty-three.  Hank Hanegraaff suggests, "Our DNA is programmed in such a way that, at a particular point, we reach optimal
					development from a functional perspective.  For the most part, it appears that we reach this stage somewhere in our twenties and
					thirties ... If the blueprints for our glorified bodies are in the DNA, then it would stand to reason that our bodies will be
					resurrected at the optimal stage of development determined by our DNA." (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 288-89.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what do you think?  Would that be a good age for you?  In my case, I was too skinny
				at that age (but at least I had hair!).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alcorn has another interesting comment about those who die as children:
				<blockquote>
					Does this mean that children who go to Heaven won't be children once they get there?  Or that there will be no children on the New
					Earth? ... But if <b>Isaiah 11:6-9</b> is speaking of the New Earth, as does its parallel passage in <b>Isaiah 65</b>, who are the
					infants and young children playing with the animals?  Is it possible that children, after they're resurrected on the New Earth, will be
					at the same level of development as when they died? If so, these children would presumably be allowed to grow up on the New Earth --
					a childhood that would be enviable, to say the least!  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 289-90.)
				</blockquote>
				That is thought provoking and seems reasonable.  But again, it is very plain that we do not know anything for sure about the age or state
				of maturity the Lord will set for each of us when we are resurrected or transformed, as the case may be.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maybe the ultimate truth about all this is that our "age" will cease to have any real
				meaning.  It seems likely that we will have mature bodies and minds along with the abilities, energy, and attitudes of youth  -- boundless
				energy, spontaneity, curiosity, and joy.  As we sometimes say even now, "Age is just a number."  Some people look and act their age while
				others do not (for either good or ill).  But in that eternal Kingdom, the aging process will not be relevant nor a detriment to our
				physical or mental abilities.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having considered what state of maturity (or "age") we would be when God brings us into
				His kingdom, we will continue with the sub-question ...</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Will we be able to <u>or</u> will it be necessary for us to eat in Heaven?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eating and drinking are vital components in the human experience.  Many aspects of human
				interactions center around meals -- business, holidays, ceremonies, etc. Much of mankind's interaction involves food and drink.  In the
				Bible there are around 1200 references to eating, meals, food and feasts.  It has been said there is much more emphasis on feasting than
				fasting.  So understanding that we will be in real, physical resurrection bodies, is there any reason to assume that there will be no
				eating or drinking in Heaven?  Some say 'No'  because of <b>Romans 14:17</b>. But Paul is speaking about the wrongness of eating and
				drinking when it hurts the conscience of your brother and sister (e.g. meat offered to idols), not about the state of affairs in Heaven.
				Others use <b>Revelation 7:16</b> to deny eating and drinking in Heaven.  But the point there is that people will not suffer from hunger
				and thirst, not that they will never eat or drink again.  Actually, hunger and thirst are not really problems if you have sufficient
				resources available to satisfy them -- cf. <b>Rev. 7:17</b>. And, in fact, hunger and thirst make the experience of eating and drinking
				more enjoyable.  If you are already full then even very good food is not very appealing (at least for most people).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now consider the following passages: <b>Matthew 8:11; Luke 14:15-16</b> (note that
				Jesus does not contradict the man's statement but rather tells a parable to clarify his statement); <b>Luke 22:18; Luke 22:29-30;
				Revelation 2:7; Revelation 19:9; Revelation 22:1-2</b>.  From these passages it seems that our practice/custom/experience of eating and
				drinking will continue in the kingdom of God.  Also one could even infer from John's reference to the "water of life" and "tree of life"
				that we may <b>need</b> to partake of the sustenance God provides in order to continue on in eternity, or in other words, to continue to
				have eternal life we must eat and drink as we do now.  If that seems not quite right, ask yourself if Adam and Eve, who were created to
				live eternally and were not under the sentence of death until after the fall, needed to eat?  It seems logical that they did or why would
				the Lord bother with all the fruit bearing trees for their provision?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's address a couple of other issues with eating and drinking that make some
				uncomfortable with the idea that we will (or must) continue to do so in Heaven.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Digestion and elimination.</b>  That seems awfully, um, "earthy" -- not "heavenly"
				at all! But again where is our eternal heavenly home?  It seems right here on a New Earth!  And, further, we should ask: Did Adam and Eve
				have stomachs, digestive tracts, etc. before the fall?  We would certainly assume so.  Could God change things so that we process food and
				drink differently so we have no waste products?  Yes, He could ... but would He?  It's possible but, in my opinion, unnecessary and,
				thus, unlikely because if everything was "good" before the fall, why do we need a redesign?  To say digestion is "bad" goes back to
				Christoplatonism where we are bringing our ideas of what should and should not be, "good" and "bad" to the subject.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Eating meat</b>.  In the very beginning mankind only ate that which came from
				plants and trees and it was not until later after the flood that He allowed the eating of animals -- cf. <b>Genesis 1:28-29; 9:1-3</b>.
				It makes sense that before the fall there would be no eating of meat since it would have meant that animals would have died in a
				creation which at that point in time did not know death.  But what about between the fall and the flood, or between the time death
				actually came into the world and the time God actually sanctioned eating flesh?  Randy Alcorn weighs in, assuming that people did not
				eat meat until after the flood:
				<blockquote>
					Perhaps it was still unthinkable so close to Eden.  (The genealogies of Genesis 5 indicate that Noah's father Lamech was born before
					Adam died.)  Perhaps animals still held a remnant of intelligence not yet sufficiently dissipated by the Fall.  (Heaven, p.295.)
				</blockquote>
				NOTE:  That last statement pertains to Alcorn's idea that perhaps before the fall animals were much more intelligent than they are now
				with a greater capacity to communicate (e.g., serpent speaking to Eve in Eden did not seem to shock her; also Balaam's donkey).  It would
				be hard to slaughter and eat another being who could plead for mercy.  Against this theory is the fact that animal sacrifices as a
				means of worship were already in place well before the flood -- cf. <b>Genesis 4:4</b>.  And also by Noah's day, besides him and his
				family, there was only evil in the world (cf. <b>Gen. 6:11-12</b>) so perhaps people were already eating meat even before God officially
				sanctioned it.  But then why did God sanction it at that point (after the flood) though?  Perhaps the fall also affected vegetation so
				that mankind could not get all the nutrients needed for good health from plants alone as they could when everything was 'good.'</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have been saying that the best way to gain insight into how things may be in the
				New Earth is to compare it to what we can discern about Eden from the Scriptures.  If that approach is valid and in light of
				<b>Revelation 21:4</b>, it seems that mankind will once more become vegetarians after the Lord returns.  Most of us enjoy meat in our
				diet and so that may seem to be a bit of a bummer ("No more ribeye steaks?"). But I do not think we will be disappointed in the culinary
				fare  to which we are treated in the kingdom of God.  Let's just say, you probably haven't yet discovered your favorite food for that is
				still to come when God restores all things -- including the potency, vibrancy and deliciocity (yes, I made that word up) of all the food
				He originally intended for His people.  I believe God wants us to look forward to eating at His table.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having finished our multi-part question regarding what our physical bodies will be
				that followed our discussion about our emotions and personality in Heaven, we will turn to what we might call the third major component of
				who we are as individuals.

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven20.htm">Question 19</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 18: Will our relationships in Heaven resemble the relationships we have now
				on earth?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Will they be similar but with key changes?  Or maybe they are absolutely different?  Or
				perhaps even eliminated completely? To explore this let's consider the most common and important relationships we experience now and see
				what we can find:</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A spouse</b>.  The most direct reference to this relationship in Heaven is seen in
				<b>Matthew 22:28-30</b>.  Now understandably that passage is troubling to some.  Randy Alcorn has some good things to say here so I am going
				to share an extended excerpt from his book Heaven:
				<blockquote>
					<p>There's a great deal of regret and misunderstanding about this passage.  A woman wrote me, "I struggle with the idea that there won't
					be marriage in heaven. I believe I'll really miss it."</p>
					<p> But the Bible does not teach there will be no marriage in Heaven.  In fact, it makes clear there will be marriage in Heaven.  What
					it says is that there will be one marriage, between Christ and his bride -- and we'll all be part of it.  Paul links human marriage to
					the higher reality it mirrors: "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will
					become one flesh.  This is a profound mystery -- but I am talking about Christ and the church" (<b>Ephesians 5:31-32</b>).</p>
					<p>The one-flesh marital union we know on Earth is a signpost pointing to our relationship with Christ as our bridegroom.  Once we
					reach the destination, the signpost becomes unnecessary.  That one marriage -- our marriage to Christ -- will be so completely
					satisfying that even the most wonderful earthly marriage couldn't be as fulfilling.  Earthly marriage is a shadow, a copy, an echo of
					the true and ultimate marriage. Once that ultimate marriage begins, at the Lamb's wedding feast, all the human marriages that pointed
					to it will have served their noble purpose and will be assimilated into the one great marriage they foreshadowed. 'The purpose of
					marriage is not to replace Heaven, but to prepare us for it.'</p>
					<p> Here on Earth we long for a perfect marriage.  That's exactly what we'll have -- a perfect marriage with Christ.  My wife, Nanci,
					is my best friend and my closest sister in Christ.  Will we become more distant in the new world?  Of course not -- we'll become closer,
					I'm convinced.  The God who said, "It is not good for man to be alone" (<b>Gen. 2:18</b>) is the giver and blesser of our
					relationships.</p>
					<p>Life on this earth matters.  What we do here touches strings that reverberate for all eternity.  Nothing will take away from the
					fact that Nanci and I are marriage partners here and that we invest so much of our lives in each other, serving Christ together.  I
					fully expect no one besides God will understand me better on the New Earth, and there's nobody whose company I'll seek and enjoy more
					than Nanci's. ... Jesus said the institution of marriage would end, having fulfilled its purpose.  But he never hinted that deep
					relationships between married people would end. ... The relationship built during one kind of partnership often carries over to a
					permanent friendship after the partnership has ended. ... God usually doesn't replace his original creation, but when he does, he
					replaces it with something that is far better, never worse.  Mormons attempt to have marriages permanently bound for eternity, but
					this disregards Christ's direct statement.  Being married to Christ will be the ultimate thrill. (<b><i>Heaven</i></b> pp. 336-37.)</p>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of Alcorn's statements assume a good marriage where the two are truly partners and
				friends.  Not all marriages, even between believers, are that way.  So it may be that while you will remember being married to a person and
				share unique memories with him/her, other relationships may be more important or attractive to you because they were more important on earth.
				Also there may be two believers who were in less than ideal marriages who, after being changed in Heaven to the best versions of themselves,
				may reconcile and understand each other better.  But whether this means they will automatically become very close (best friends) now in the
				New Earth is uncertain.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we consider other common relationships we have now to see if and how they may change
				in Heaven, something to think about is whether having something like a "best friend" is even compatible with the concept of Heaven.  Won't
				everyone love everyone else equally?  Hmmm ... We'll eventually talk about that.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because it is such a profound relationship experience, we talked extensively about
				marriage and how it may change in Heaven for those who engage in it in this life. Now let's turn our attention to other kinds of human
				connections as we continue to explore ...</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Parent/child</b>.  There are many facets to a parent and child relationship.  However
				probably the most defining aspect of such a bond is encapsulated in the word "responsibility."  Why do I say that?  First, of course we
				see this truth in scripture -- cf. <b>Ephesians 6:1-4</b>.  Paul speaks of both the child's responsibility to be respectful and obedient
				to his parents <u>and</u> makes reference to the parental obligation to nurture their children in all ways, especially spiritually.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But this is something recognized even by those who do not have a high regard for the
				Bible. It is accepted in all civilized societies that parents have the responsibility to care and provide for their kids, encouraging
				proper development in all areas until such time that they are adults.  And if they do not do so, those who see the neglect are aghast
				because this is the basic role of a parent.  And, of course, because in most cases good parents are motivated by love and such neglect
				indicates the absence of love, which is unnatural.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Likewise if a child is a disrespectful brat who only tries to take advantage of his
				parent's love for him, he himself is disdained as someone not in keeping with that natural law of honoring those who first gave him life
				and the subsequent nurturing to continue in it.  Additionally, as both parents and children get older, roles may reverse somewhat and the
				children may need to help provide care for the parents. Those who refuse, when able to do so, are seen as cold hearted indeed. Thus we
				see, I think, that the key word in this relationship truly is "responsibility". So what, if anything, about this dynamic changes when
				the kingdom of God is established?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Revelation 21:1-7; 22:1-5</b> provides some answers. God becomes the Father of us
				all.  He will assume all responsibility for all of us in all things. He will first remake us into the best possible version of ourselves;
				He will clothe us;  He will provide for us a perfect, safe and beautiful home in which to live;  He will feed us;  He will bring us all
				together in perfect fellowship and etc., etc., etc.  Anything a loving, responsible parent should provide, God will provide and more.
				We will not need a human parental relationship like we had on earth anymore because we will not be responsible for each other's necessary
				care any longer.  We will remember those who were our parents and children and will, no doubt, appreciate and have a sense of gratefulness
				for their love and care, but it will not be a relationship of <u>dependence</u>. We will have that sort of relationship with the Lord.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We get an inkling of that even now as children grow up, move out, provide for their
				living, establish their own families, make their own decisions and so on.  We stay in contact, help each other as we can, and cherish
				both the memories and the continuing relationship.  However, the dynamics are changed from dependency to something more akin to a
				friendship of peers.  Just so Heaven, I think.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Final thought regarding children:</b> What about children not able to experience a
				full childhood? What about adults who greatly desired but did not have the opportunity to be parents because of some great loss? Randy
				Alcorn (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 289-90) theorizes that since <b>Isaiah 11:6-9</b> and <b>ch. 65</b>, both of which seem to be speaking
				of God's kingdom, do mention the presence of children, God may have some reason to bring certain ones into His kingdom at the development
				stage of childhood.  He suggests that in Heaven, God may restore certain opportunities to us which were denied on earth.  Perhaps a child
				whose life was cut short will pick up at the age he/she left off on earth.  Perhaps believing parents losing a child in its infancy will
				be granted the opportunity to raise him/her in God's kingdom. Who knows?  Nobody except God.  It would be another extravagant gesture of
				God's infinite goodness and grace to His own children if He did.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far we have considered the marriage relationship and the parent-child relationship.
				Those are two of the closest and most profound personal connections that we experience.  But there are others which are also very important.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Siblings/relatives</b>.  Many of the same principles considered with the parent-child
				relationship would hold true here.  We would certainly recognize each other as earthly brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, nephews,
				nieces, and so on.  And because of those blood ties, we would also certainly share special memories unique to those relationships.  Wyatt
				Earp's father was given credit in the Kevin Costner movie for saying something along the lines of: "It's blood that counts.  Everyone else
				is just a stranger." He was trying to instill in his children the importance of family sticking together and taking care of each other.
				And there is a place for family loyalty and closeness (especially in the wild, wild West in the late 1800s, I suppose).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet even here on earth, we see the family relationships of our youth often take a back
				seat to other relationships we develop as adults.  Part of this is simply our proximity to each other -- cf. <b>Proverbs 27:10</b>.  It
				is easier and more natural to develop and  maintain relationships with those nearby who we see on a regular basis than with those far away.
				The point is that even the closest of blood ties can fade if neglected.  And most of the time such bonds are neglected because the two
				brothers or cousins, or whatever relative it may be, go different directions -- either literally (geographically) or figuratively (in
				their life choices).  This leads us to what Jesus had to say about this subject -- cf. <b>Matthew 12:46-50</b>.  To Jesus, blood based
				bonds are not as important as spiritual based ones.  It is almost impossible for those who are going in different directions spiritually
				to have the kind of fellowship which would lead to true closeness -- cf. <b>Amos 3:3</b>.  And what that means is that quite often when
				someone chooses to follow Jesus, he or she will find that past relationships may grow colder (even close family) if they are not true
				followers of Christ.  But Jesus replaces those relationships with spiritual brothers and sisters -- cf. <b>Matthew 19:29</b>. Of course,
				in Heaven, all who are there will be <b>"agreed"</b>.  So what does that mean?  We will all be brothers and sisters living with our
				heavenly Father.  As I said, we will be aware of our earthly family relationships and, as observed about husbands and wives, we would
				not expect to grow more distant from each other in Heaven.  Yet our closeness there (at least to start with) will largely depend on how
				close we were on earth.  Close family all following Jesus will most likely pick up where they left off while others, not as close (for
				whatever reasons), may have to re-cultivate their relationships. Or not ...</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Business associates/co-workers/colleagues</b>.  We have discussed that the fundamental
				nature of "work" will change in the New Earth.  We'll no longer be just "making a living" since  God Himself will provide all our needs.
				Instead, because the curse has been lifted, we are free to do "work" that's enjoyable and fulfilling. Thus if our work on earth was drudgery
				to us, we will probably not be engaged in that sort of employment (or it may not even exist anymore).  So our new work will probably mean
				that we will have new associates and new relationships. We will remember our earthly jobs but may not see our former colleagues much
				(assuming they are in Heaven).  <b>OR</b> perhaps the coworkers you had here were also experiencing the same drudgery and yearnings as
				you, so in Heaven you are reunited in a new field together and pick right up where you left off.  <b>OR</b> maybe you loved what you did
				on earth and so did the others you worked with and so you are all doing it in the New Earth as before and, again, you pick back up where
				you left off.  <b>OR</b> ... OK, so I think the big picture here is that the experience of having colleagues/relationships in our Heavenly
				work will have the good parts (camaraderie, common goals, team work, etc.) without the baggage (unhealthy competition, friction, power
				struggles, etc.) that goes with them at times.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far we have considered marriage, parent-child, siblings and relatives, and work
				relationships.  We'll now cover just a couple of other categories and then come back to a question I raised earlier.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Teachers/mentors</b>.  We have discussed the fact that most likely we will still be
				learning in Heaven.  And if that is true and the Lord is not going to simply fill our minds with all the knowledge we'll ever need, then
				why wouldn't some among us become teachers of the things in which we are expert? Most people love to share knowledge they have acquired.
				And there would always be people who decide they want to learn a new skill since they have unlimited time (e.g., Bill Murray's character
				Phil Connors in the movie Groundhog Day where, because he keeps reliving the same day over and over, finally decides to use it
				constructively and, among other things, learns to play piano, sculpt ice, etc.).  However, I myself would see such a relationship as more
				of a voluntary, peer-to-peer sort of interaction and less of a formal, necessary professor-to-pupil sort of dynamic where the teacher has
				power to require certain behaviors and where the student faces such consequences as a failing grade or being discharged from his position.
				There would be respect for the instructor's knowledge and skill on the part of the student, of course, but the relationship would still be
				based on those two being equals.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Friends</b>.  This is probably the most widespread sort of personal interaction or
				dynamic.  We only have one spouse (at least in Western culture ... except in Utah ... ), only one set of parents, and a limited number of
				siblings and relatives and coworkers.  <b>But</b> most people have a wide variety of people who they would describe as a "friend".
				<b>And</b> the usage of the term "friend" can overlap with most of the other relationships.  Many have said, "My <<u>insert relationship</u>>
				is my best friend." So to save this category of relationship to the end may seem unnecessary. If you are blessed with another believer who
				is very special and close to you, it seems almost redundant now to say that you will no doubt pick up where you left off and continue to
				build on that relationship into eternity.  And if you, for some reason, have mostly casual friends but no extremely close one, it may just
				be you have not met that person yet.  But don't worry!  If we can grow close to someone in a mere lifetime, what about after millennia?
				And of course we hearken back to the thought that ultimately, Jesus Himself is our closest friend and confidant.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Which re-raises that question from before:</b>  Is it even appropriate to think of
				friendship in Heaven in terms of some being closer than others?  Doesn't that imply exclusion and dislike? Let me once again share a thought
				from Randy Alcorn:
				<blockquote>
					Will some friendships be closer than others?   Augustine claimed, "In the city of God there will be no special friendships. All special
					attachments will be absorbed into one comprehensive and undifferentiated community of love. The universalized love of heaven permits
					no exclusive, restricted circles of friends." But how does this position stand up to Scripture?  Just because we'll be sinless doesn't
					mean we won't be drawn to certain people more than others.  We'll like everyone, but we'll be closer to some than others.  Jesus was
					closer to John than to any of the other disciples.  Jesus was closer to Peter, James and John than to the rest of the Twelve, and
					closer to the Twelve than to the seventy, and closer to the seventy than to his other followers.  He was close to Lazarus and Martha,
					and closer still to their sister Mary.  He was so close to his mother that while he was dying on the cross, he instructed John to care
					for her after his death.  Since Christ was closer to some people than to others, clearly there can't be anything wrong with it.  In
					Heaven there won't be cliques, exclusiveness, arrogance, posturing, belittling, or jealousy.  But when friends particularly enjoy each
					other's company, they are reflecting God's design.  If, as you walk about the New Jerusalem, you see Adam and Eve holding hands as they
					stand looking at the tree of life, would you begrudge them their special friendship?"  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 343.)
				</blockquote>
				We will now turn to a larger overarching type of question.  We will need to break it into several smaller parts as we have done with a few
				other such questions. The big question in this case is ...

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven13.htm">Question 12</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 11:  Is it possible that the information in <b>Rev. 21-22</b> about
				New Jerusalem is symbolic so that what we see described there isn't real?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly there are those who doubt that the descriptions we have seen represent a
				literal, real city.  There are two or three different types of approaches to such thinking though they may all be connected or used by
				the same person:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Some doubters want to point out the problems such a huge city would create in terms of physics or natural law.  One example is the
						height of such a city would be above earth's oxygenated atmosphere (I guess we might as well forget about colonizing Mars!).
					</li>
					<li>
						Another is that such a large city would throw off the planet's orbit.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Such folks as these have a bigger problem -- they don't believe Genesis 1:1 which prevents them from believing the rest of the Bible.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some skeptics have been infected with Christoplatonic ideas, which we've already alluded
				to, that the physical/material is inherently unholy and has no place in heaven (which is why we keep re-emphasizing the real bodies, etc.
				we'll have in heaven).
				<blockquote>
					NOTE:  Alcorn had a good Christian man tell him that eating, drinking, other physical activities in Heaven seemed to him to be "terribly unspiritual".
				</blockquote>
				Some Bible students think of Revelation only in figurative terms and believe taking anything as literal is risky.
				<blockquote>
					NOTE:  Certainly I agree there is symbolism in some of the measurements and architecture of New Jerusalem.  The repeated use of the
					number twelve, the red color of the jasper wall of protection, access gates of pearl -- the precious jewel produced through pain, the
					shape of the city, and on and on we could go.  But just because there is symbolic meaning attached to something doesn't always preclude
					its existence as a real object.  Alcorn points to his own gold wedding ring as an example of that.
				</blockquote>
				Remember we saw that some things on earth are mere copies of what's currently in heaven (and more real) -- cf. <b>Hebrews 9:23-24</b>. But
				further John's reference to "measure of a man" in <b>Rev. 21:17</b> seems to cry out "Please take this literally!"</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have been looking at what the Bible reveals that the Lord is preparing as  a home
				for us in heaven.  Of course, much has to be left to the imagination because the Bible does not provide a complete blueprint or even an
				artist's sketch of what to expect.  So we are left with questions.  But an even more fundamental question to some may have to do with our
				own perceptions of the place due to potential changes in our personal make-up or character. We've touched on it but now we'll try to fully
				address ...

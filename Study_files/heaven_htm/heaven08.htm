			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 7: What would be the effects of the "curse" being removed so as to
				establish a heavenly home on the New Earth for believers?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we speak of the 'curse' we refer to what happened in Eden with the first two humans,
				Adam and Eve (<b>Genesis 3:6-13, 16-19</b>).  It is because of this that a renovation of the earth is needed.  Consider all the changes for
				the worse that occurred because of their sin:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Their innocence was gone.
					</li>
					<li>
						They knew good and evil; knew that they were naked; experienced shame, guilt, and fear for the first time.
					</li>
					<li>
						Their relationships were damaged.
					</li>
					<li>
						They hid from God and they blamed each other for their own problems.
					</li>
					<li>
						Life, even the birthing of it, becomes painful.
					</li>
					<li>
						The battle of the  sexes, the struggle for dominance, begins.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sustaining life becomes a matter of hard work.
					</li>
					<li>
						The nature of the ground itself is changed so it resists man's efforts to produce food.
					</li>
					<li>
						Physical death intrudes into God's creation and becomes the destiny of all living things.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Romans 8:19-22</b> speaks to the comprehensive scope of the curse -- it affects the "whole creation."  We see it reflected in the Second
				Law of Thermodynamics and the Law of Entropy, both of which point to the fact that when anything is left to itself with no additional inputs
				of energy, it will run down and/or decay.  There are examples everywhere.
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since we have been living with this reality all our lives (and for almost the entirety
				of mankind's history), it is natural and normative for us.  It's difficult to imagine life in any other context.  <b>But let's dream a
				little about the curse being gone...</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How would our concept of 'working' change?  A <b>major</b> part of our existence is
				performing some sort of activity/service/labor to earn enough to support ourselves with the necessities of life.  Though there are a few
				exceptions, most people see "work" as a necessary evil.  Given the opportunity they would choose to spend their time doing something else.
				This is the kind of work the line in the song <i>Big Rock Candy Mountain</i> "where they hung the jerk who invented work ..." is talking
				about (and most of us can identify, I'm sure).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now contrast that with the sort of work a man who has a shop who loves to craft fine
				furniture does; <b>or</b> a woman who loves to sew and create beautiful quilts and blankets; <b>or</b> someone who loves cooking or
				gardening or inventing <b>or</b> ...?  In short, what if work became something we did not for survival, but for pleasure?  Not that we
				have to but because we love to?  Wouldn't that be heavenly?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This, in turn, would affect our lives in other ways.  Since much of our time is given
				over to earning a living, keeping things going, or replacing them, et cetera, so very little time is left to pursue our heartfelt desires
				and fully develop our gifts and talents.  But what if creation became cooperative with our efforts instead of resistant, and things did
				not decay and need any maintenance, what if food and shelter and all the necessities were provided for us freely?  What if we could pursue
				our dreams and produce the things we were meant to and be what we were made to be? And if each one in that society could do that, how rich
				and deep and interesting could that culture become?  I'd like to live in a place like that, I think.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of a society and culture brings to mind the thought of relationships.  Most of
				us have relationships we enjoy very much but even the best of relationships suffer setbacks and have to endure through some difficult
				stretches -- and that's the best case scenario.  Many relationships completely disintegrate due to disagreements, disappointments,
				destructive behaviors, et cetera.  But what if the sense of (serious) competition was eliminated so that no more would anyone seek
				dominance over another nor would they try to elevate themselves at another's expense?  What if guilt, shame, blame, fear and hatred were
				no longer part of our reality?  What if all the people around us <b>truly</b> were our brothers and sisters, in word, thought and deed?
				Boy, that'd be nice.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what if all these things were not only unlimited in terms of energy, resources,
				sustenance, et cetera, <b>but</b> also were not bound by the constraints of <b>time</b>.  Thus, personal dreams and aspirations can be
				pursued without fear of life slipping away before achieving them.  Personal abilities are not now degraded by the effects of old age.
				Relationships can be developed for as long as desired.  What if you literally had all the time in the world to spend on whatever you
				<b>want</b>, rather than a limited amount to spend on what you <b>must</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are just a few of the implications of the 'curse' being lifted!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The implications of what we've seen so far is that mankind's "Paradise Lost"
				(cf. <b>Gen. 1-3</b>) will one day be restored  to us (cf. <b>Rev. 20-22</b>).  But that thought in itself begs a question.  Does that
				mean everything reverts back to exactly what Eden (and the rest of the world) was like in those early days described in Genesis?

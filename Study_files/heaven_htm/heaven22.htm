			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven23.htm">Question 22</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 21: Will Heaven really be as great as it is thought to be or could it
				become tedious?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To demonstrate what some think about what Heaven will be like, Randy Alcorn cites
				well-known science fiction author Isaac Asimov who wrote:
				<blockquote>
					I don't believe in the afterlife, so I don't have to spend my whole life fearing hell, or fearing heaven even more.  For whatever
					the tortures of hell, I think the boredom of heaven would be even worse. (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 393.)
				</blockquote>
				In this session we want to explore the reasoning behind such a statement.  Why do some (possibly even some Christians) picture Heaven
				from that perspective?  There are several possible answers, all of which may contribute in some degree to this erroneous attitude:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Unlimited time may be very frightening for those whose lives have no real purpose</b>.  I have suggested that, for me anyway,
						one of the amazing benefits I see regarding heaven is not having to worry about the passing or shortage of time.  For myself, it
						seems I am continuously up against a deadline to have something prepared, or to be somewhere, or to get something done and the
						thought of not having to stress about that sounds very good.  But for someone who is trying to fill his time but has nothing much
						to keep him occupied, it is easy to see why the thought of eternal life might seem unpleasant or even terrifying.  In the movie
						<b>The Green Mile</b> the main character is granted an enormously extended lifespan.  We eventually find out that for him it only
						meant that he had to continuously watch those around him die while he kept on living.  It actually discouraged him from seeking
						relationships because he knew it would only lead to pain.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>Fun and excitement is readily associated with sin or evil or "naughtiness," while "being good" or even God Himself is related
							to boredom</b>.  Alcorn comments:
							<blockquote>
								<p>
									"Won't it boring to be good all the time?" someone asked [me].  Note the assumption: sin is exciting and righteousness
									is boring.  We've fallen for the devil's lie.  His most basic strategy, the same one he employed with Adam and Eve, is
									to make us believe that sin brings fulfillment ...
								</p>
								<p>
									An elderly gentleman I led to Christ asked a question of a Christian employee in his care center: "Will we have fun in
									Heaven?"  "Oh, no!" the woman replied, appearing dismayed that he'd even asked.  When he told me this story, I shook
									my head, because I've heard it so often.  Why did this Christian woman respond as she did?  Because in accordance with
									the faulty assumptions of Christoplatonism, she instinctively linked fun with sin and boredom with holiness.
									(<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 394-95)
								</p>
							</blockquote>
						</p>
						<p>
							This lie is reinforced by the fact that many carnal activities which are forbidden in God's Word do provide the quick buzz,
							or sudden intense pleasure (cf. <b>Hebrews 11:25</b>).  So because things like gluttony, drunkenness, fornication, etc. are
							condemned, people mistakenly conclude that God is against good times and fun.  Thus Heaven will be a terribly boring and
							stifling place.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Since everything is "perfect" in Heaven it is not possible that there can be any new challenges.</b>  People rightly understand
						that much satisfaction comes from solving problems, overcoming obstacles, improving one's skills and personal growth.  But they
						wrongly assume that in Heaven these things are absent -- Alcorn comments:
						<blockquote>
							Someone told me nobody will enjoy playing golf in Heaven because it would get boring always hitting holes in one.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Some professing believers think Heaven will be boring based on the fact that their own Christian experience is drab and
						unexciting</b>. But whose fault is that?  It is often the case that two people going through the same experience may have very
						different responses to that experience based solely on what they themselves bring to it.  People often think that Christianity
						(even their own) is boring.  This may be due to the fact that they think (have been taught) that to be a Christian one has to try
						to be "good" all the time.  Thus they spend their time and effort being "nice".  Don't misunderstand -- being "nice" and "good"
						are proper for general Christian demeanor, but there is much more to it than that!  Was Jesus "nice" all the time
						(cf. <b>Matthew 21:12-13</b>)?
					</li>
				</ol>
				Uh-oh.  Now we're starting to respond to the reasoning behind the thinking that Heaven will be boring.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While addressing this next-to-last question I want to review and sort of consolidate
			some thoughts we have discussed at several different points in the study.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have examined four possible reasons people sometimes use to defend the idea that
				Heaven will be  unbearably boring. There may be other reasons and excuses people give to try to explain why they are ambivalent about
				Heaven, but these seem to cover most of the variations.  Are they valid?  Now that we have gone through this study you should be able
				to answer most of the concerns.  But let's go through them and offer a response to each.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first assumption, thinking unlimited time will be impossible to fill up with
				interesting and fulfilling activity, implies the residents of the New Earth won't be busy or have purpose.  We have seen  the purpose of
				redemption and the restoration of all things is to make all things right.  Part of that is that we are free to become what we were made
				and gifted to be.  This means our activities and occupations will be satisfying, worthwhile and enjoyable.  Also Jesus teaches that there
				will be responsibilities in Heaven -- cf. <b>Luke 19:17</b>.  It's not just lollygagging in the clouds practicing on harps (where did that
				image come from anyway?).  And besides all that, who says we will be limited to this planet to pass the time?  Yes I think the New Earth
				will be "home sweet home" but why create such an enormous universe if God did not intend for it to be explored?  If we are to have dominion
				over all His creation we'll need to get out there and have a look at it.  Yes, that seems a huge undertaking since space is infinite.  Just
				the thing, then, to fill up and occupy the "excessive" amount of time we'll have.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We saw that the second assumption that sin and evil bring fun and fulfillment and God
				and goodness are boring is a lie from Satan.  Randy Alcorn speaks well to this:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						People sometimes say, "I'd rather be having a good time in hell than be bored in Heaven."  Many people imagine Hell as a place where
						they'll hang around, shoot pool, and joke with friends.  That could happen on the New Earth, but not in Hell.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hell is a place of torment and isolation, where friendship and good times don't exist. Hell will be deadly boring. Everything good,
						enjoyable, refreshing, fascinating, and interesting is derived from God.  Without God there's nothing interesting to do. ...
					</p>
					<p>
						Our belief that Heaven will be boring betrays a heresy -- that God is boring. There's no greater nonsense.  Our desire for
						pleasure and the experience of joy comes directly from God's hand.  He made our taste buds, adrenaline, sex drives, and the
						nerve endings that convey pleasure to our brains.  Likewise our imaginations and our capacity for joy and exhilaration were made
						by the very God we accuse of being boring.  Are we so arrogant as to imagine that human beings came up with the idea of having
						fun? ...
					</p>
					<p>
						Those who believe that excitement can't exist without sin are thinking with sin-poisoned minds.  Drug addicts are convinced that
						without drugs they can't live happy lives.  In fact -- as everyone else can see -- drugs make them miserable.  Freedom from sin
						will mean freedom to be what God intended, freedom to find far greater joy in everything. (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 393-94.)
					</p>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third assumption that "perfection" means all challenges and obstacles are removed
				(in other words we never make a mistake or fall short of a goal) is not based in Scripture.  The idea of perfection in Heaven relates
				primarily to <b>moral</b> perfection -- the absence of sin and evil.  But that does not mean the Lord will remove all failure from His
				kingdom.  What is it that strengthens and stretches us?  What is maybe the most satisfying experience we can have personally?  Perhaps
				it is when we have faced a daunting task or test and, having failed, come back and overcome it later.  We have seen that people need to
				grow and develop and learn.  It is part of what makes us human.  It does not seem reasonable the Lord would eliminate the aspects which
				stimulate such growth from the New Earth.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fourth and final reason speaks more directly to believers whose lives of faith are
				not very exciting to them.  Again let me quote Alcorn:
				<blockquote>
					Another reason people assume Heaven is boring is that their Christian lives are boring.  That's not God's fault; it's their own.  God
					calls us to follow him in an adventure that should put us on life's edge.  He's infinite in creativity, goodness, beauty, and power.
					If we're experiencing the invigorating stirrings of God's Spirit, trusting him to fill our lives with divine appointments, experiencing
					the childlike delights of his gracious daily kindnesses, then we'll know that God is exciting and Heaven is exhilarating.
					(<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 395.)

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we come to the very last question of this study we are going to think about some of
				the conclusions we can draw about what we have learned and discussed.

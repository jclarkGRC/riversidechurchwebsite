			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven06.htm">Question 5</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question #4: If Heaven is a physical place (or has some  physical properties) how
				do the current inhabitants (human spirits) interact there?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important to remember that human beings are and have always been both physical and
				spiritual in nature (Cf. <b>Genesis 2:7</b>).
				<blockquote>
					NOTE: We are told here there was not (and has never been) a pre-existing human spirit waiting for a body, as Mormons teach. Rather,
					God creates them together.  We are also told that without the union of body and spirit a person cannot be whole (fully human).  A
					disembodied spirit is in an unnatural and undesirable state of being.  That's why physical death is such a terrible thing -- it
					separates the body and spirit.  Now add to the equation that the intermediate Heaven seems to be a physical place and it follows that
					our existence there without a body would be disconcerting, even unpleasant or frustrating, if nothing is done about it.
				</blockquote>
				Randy Alcorn writes:
				<blockquote>
					Given the consistent physical descriptions of the intermediate Heaven and those who dwell there, it seems possible -- though this is
					certainly debatable -- that between our earthly life and our bodily resurrection, God may grant us some physical form that will allow
					us to function as human beings while in that unnatural state "between bodies" awaiting our resurrection. Just as the intermediate state
					is a bridge between life on the old Earth and the New Earth, perhaps intermediate bodies, or at least a physical form of some sort,
					serve as bridges between our present bodies and our resurrected bodies.  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 57)
				</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does that seem like a silly idea? Before dismissing it, consider that we know of at
				least one Person with a physical body currently living in the intermediate heaven -- cf. <b>Acts 7:56</b> -- so we know it is possible to
				inhabit and function there as such.  It is true that Jesus has a resurrected body so that may not be the best evidence of intermediate
				bodies but at least we have further proof that the present Heaven has physical properties.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider also Enoch (<b>Genesis 5:24</b>) and Elijah (<b>II Kings 2:11-12</b>) who were
				taken into Heaven without dying (so no separation).  How can bodies under the Curse enter Heaven?  Either God extended preserving grace or
				changed them some other way.  It is a mystery but we know they are in heaven with their bodies.  Thus it must be conceded that it is possible
				for others who have gone there to also be provided some sort of body.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of Elijah, look at <b>Luke 9:30</b>.  The three disciples were able to recognize
				them as men and tell their identities.  Elijah could have had his original body but Moses could not have (cf. <b>Deut. 34:5-6</b>).  Was
				this a temporary body given him while waiting for the resurrection?  Or was he disembodied at death, given a form while talking to Jesus
				and again disembodied afterward?  The former scenario seems more likely to me.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What about Paul's experience and testimony in <b>II Corinthians 12:2-4</b>?  Twice he
				expresses uncertainty about whether or not he had a body  while caught up to Paradise.  Maybe it seemed to him he had a physical form and
				experienced things in Heaven through it but it was somehow different than his earthly body, thus creating the uncertainty.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John also had various experiences in Heaven which are described in a physical way
				(e.g., <b>Rev. 10:8-10</b>) though some would say that it was a vision or figurative language (cf. <b>Rev. 4:1-2</b>).  But is it possible
				God actually brought John up in spirit and gave him a form while there?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider the information provided in <b>Luke 16:19-31</b>.  While some believe  this
				is a parable only meant to teach that choices in life have eternal consequences, there is reason to think Jesus is speaking of a real
				person -- e.g., why choose the name of his good friend destined to die, possibly causing confusion?  If fictitious, why not choose another
				name?  Now we should not press every detail (it seems unlikely people in Heaven and hell can all speak to each other).  Nevertheless we
				see that the three men, Abraham, Lazarus and the rich man all had forms and were recognizable -- they had faces, torsos, fingers, tongues
				(and I assume the rest of the body to go with them).  They could see, talk, feel comfort, feel pain, feel heat (thirst?), remember, move
				around, be hindered.  It seems real.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is this conclusive? No. Heaven will be a mystery until we arrive.  But certainly Heaven
				seems to be a place where we'll have "real" experiences.  It makes sense God would enable us to function there with some physical form.
				But what is it like to be there?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can see that it is plausible to think that, for humans who have died and, thus, do not
				have their own body in the intermediate Heaven, the Lord may provide a temporary form so that they may function normally.  But that begs
				another question: what does 'normal' look like in Heaven?  Or, in other words ... </font></p>

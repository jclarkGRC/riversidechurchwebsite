			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 1: If heaven is a real place, where is it and has anyone ever seen it?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps we can start with simple directions.  Whenever anyone (in almost any context)
				refers to heaven (and/or hell) which way does he or she look or point?  Heaven is up and hell is down, right?  Is there biblical
				justification for these general assumptions and beliefs?
				<ul>
					<li>
						For hell see: <b>Psalm 55:15; Luke 8:30-31; Luke 16:22-23; Revelation 20:2-3</b>.
					</li>
					<li>
						For heaven see: <b>Psalm 14:2; John 3:13; II Corinthians 12:2-4</b>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Quick Question:  Does Paul's mention of the third heaven confirm the Mormon idea of the three levels of heaven -- celestial,
						terrestrial, and telestial?  If not, then what did he mean? It was common for Jews to refer to three heavens but not as Latter-Day
						Saints do.
					</p>
					<p>
						To them the "first heaven" is our atmosphere where birds fly and clouds float.  The "second heaven" is the starry expanse, or what
						we call outer space.  Thus, the "third heaven" is the dwelling place of God and angels and the departed saints.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				OK, so we are primarily speaking of the "third heaven" or "Paradise" where God dwells.  And we have seen that it is correct biblically to
				consider that this heaven is "up" or maybe "somewhere out there" (as Fievel might say).  But has anyone you know ever actually seen it?
				For that matter, have we seen all of the second heaven yet?
				<blockquote>
					In April, 1961, the first man in space, Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was reported to have said during his initial orbit of earth
					that, "I don't see any God up here."  It is currently disputed whether he actually said it or not.
				</blockquote>
				But the main point is: Can heaven be observed by humans?  To help answer this, recall Paul's words in <b>II Corinthians</b> and also see
				<b>Acts 7:55-56</b> and <b>Revelation 4:1-2</b>.
				<blockquote>
					NOTE:   I know there have been many modern instances of people claiming to have had near-death visions/experiences regarding heaven.
					Since I do not know any of these people personally and thus cannot vouch for their characters I place little, if any, stock in their
					accounts.  There are too many possible reasons for such stories -- desire for fame, monetary  profit, or simply being deluded by one's
					own mind in a time of illness.
				</blockquote>
				But we know that the testimonies of Scripture are true and those accounts are sufficient for us to know that when God has allowed it, men
				have seen into a real heaven.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, if real, where is it? Is it part of our space/time universe but so far out there
				that we've no chance of reaching it physically?  Or maybe it is very close but operating on a different frequency, so to speak? (See
				<b>II Kings 6:17</b>)
				<blockquote>
					Randy Alcorn shares:  "The present Heaven is normally invisible to those living on Earth.  For those who have trouble accepting the
					reality of an unseen realm, consider the perspective of cutting-edge researchers who embrace string theory.  Scientists at Yale,
					Princeton, and Stanford, among others, postulate that there are ten unobservable dimensions and likely an infinite number of
					imperceptible universes.  If this is what leading scientists believe, why should anyone feel self-conscious about believing in one
					unobservable dimension, a realm containing angels and Heaven and Hell?" (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 48.)
				</blockquote>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ultimately, we cannot know exactly where heaven is located right now.  But it
				may interest you to know we are getting glimpses of heaven in this life and this world.  How's that?  What do I mean? We'll see the
				answer to that as we continue in the study and see some biblical truths about the eventual location and nature of God's kingdom.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have seen that the Bible testifies clearly that heaven is a real place somewhere
				"above" us.  We do not know if it is  simply too far away for us to find on our own or if it is actually very close but indiscernible by
				our natural senses, meaning that we would need God's help to experience it.  Or, maybe there are other possibilities, but the bottom line is
				that we do not know exactly where it is or, perhaps rather, in what realm it exists.  Let us consider the next question.</font></p>

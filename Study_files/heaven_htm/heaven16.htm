			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven17.htm">Question 16</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 15: When we enter into the kingdom of Heaven, will we have any inclination
				toward sin at all?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am assuming most of us will say that there is no way there could be sin in Heaven
				but, before simply dismissing the possibility completely, we need to consider if there has been any situation in history where sin arose
				despite a perfect environment?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obviously two situations come immediately to mind from the Bible.  In chronological order,
				Lucifer sinned though created directly by God and dwelling in Heaven; and also Adam and Eve sinned though directly created by God and
				dwelling in Eden, also a sinless environment.  Do these not imply that just because a place is perfect, there still may be a capacity for
				humans to sin? Why or why not?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The answer seems to be that the sin had little to do with the environment but rather
				had much to do with those living in the environment.  In other words, God gave both angels and humans the capacity to exercise free will
				and choose to go against His expressed will.  But this raises another important question ...</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If God, in remaking redeemed mankind, removes the capacity (or ability) for humans to
				sin, isn't that tantamount to taking away their ability to choose (or free will)?  Wouldn't that make them less like humans and more like
				puppets or robots?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's go back and get some biblical answers to all the questions we have raised so far,
				starting with the original one about the inclination to sin.  What does the Bible say?  Cf. <b>Revelation 21:4; Romans 6:23</b>.  Reading
				the first passage by John we see that the Lord will completely remove death (and other bad, harmful things) from His kingdom.  In reading
				the second from Paul, we see that death results from sin.  Logically then, it seems that for death to be eliminated, sin must also be gone.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note in <b>Rev. 21:4</b>, John mentions that there will at that point be a new order --
				"for the former things have passed away."  Also see <b>Hebrews 9:26-28; 10:14</b> which show us that Jesus dealt with sin once for all and
				the result will be a perfect sanctification lasting <b>"forever"</b> for His people.  Back to <b>Revelation 21:27</b>, we see that neither
				sin nor sinners will ever approach God's holy city or kingdom.  It and they have been cast out forever into eternal death (i.e., separation).
				Finally, in <b>I Corinthians 15:52</b>, we see that God's people will be raised or changed to an <b>"incorruptible"</b> state.  This means,
				among perhaps other things, that they will not be sullied with sin ever again.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, none of these ideas should be new for Christians.  I simply wanted us to see
				that the Bible does indeed teach the elimination of sin from God's eternal kingdom and that Christians themselves are preserved from
				personal sin forever.  Since the Lord is holy and hates sin and will not tolerate it in His presence or in His creation, it must be then
				that, for us to be able to dwell with Him, there can be no sin in us either.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We now will discuss whether or not God's accomplishment of removing sin completely out
				of His realm (including out of us!) creates a fundamental difference in us which could be seen as a negative.  Or, in short, in losing
				the capacity to sin, would we also lose the capacity of self-determination (i.e., our free will or our ability to make real choices)?
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have discovered that the Bible teaches plainly that in the kingdom of God no sin
				whatsoever will be tolerated.  It will not exist in any size, shade, or shape.  This is not a new concept for biblically literate
				Christians and may hardly seem worth the time to talk about except that there are possible ramifications to consider which are concerning
				to some.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The above statement about sin not being allowed in God's eternal kingdom brings us back
				to the second thought we raised regarding <b>how</b> God might change us so that we are not sinful anymore.  If it is not a perfect
				environment which creates perfect holiness (and we saw that it must not be, else neither Lucifer nor Adam and Eve would have failed as
				they did) then it must have to do with a fundamental change that happens to us as people which will allow for perfect holiness.  The
				concern to some might be that God takes away our capacity to sin by removing our ability to choose, i.e., our free will.  We have stressed
				the idea of continuity from our present earthly lives and identities unto our eternal kingdom lives and identities to make the case that
				"we" will indeed still be "us" in Heaven.  So the potential issue that arises is:
				<blockquote>
					If the Lord takes away or limits our individual choices, doesn't that somehow change us into something less than what we were, i.e.,
					less than human, more like a robot?
				</blockquote>
				Valid concern or not?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To answer, first we must recognize that inabilities already exist in all of us.  In other
				words, our choices are already limited -- very drastically when you really think about it.  We can only fully exercise our free will over
				areas that we can actually control, yet we do not deny our complete humanity because of that.  For instance, I cannot choose to transform
				into some other sort of creature.  I cannot choose to fly or have other super powers.  I cannot choose to never get sick or  never have
				other problems.  I am always limited in my choices by my own human nature, my inherent abilities, and my resources.  Yet I still consider
				myself a self-determining human being who can think and decide about a great many of life's matters.  So even if God did remove something
				in us that restricted our ability to choose to sin (and I am <u>not</u> saying that He will), but would that be so different than what we
				are as 	humans right now?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, though we have drawn parallels between the situation of Adam and Eve in Eden and
				God's eternal kingdom to gain perspective on what we might expect in some instances (we've referred to it as a "returning to original
				specifications" at times), <u>still</u> there will be some drastic differences.  Randy Alcorn puts it well:
				<blockquote>
					Some people believe that if we have free will in Heaven, we'll have to be free to sin, as were the first humans.  But Adam and Eve's
					situation was different.  They were innocent but had not been made righteous by Christ.  We, on the other hand, become righteous through
					Christ's atonement:  "For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of
					the one man the many will be made righteous" (<b>Romans 5:19</b>).  To suggest we could have Christ's righteousness yet sin is to say
					Christ could sin.  God completely delivers us from sin -- including vulnerability to sin.  Even now we may "participate in the divine
					nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires" (<b>2 Peter 1:4</b>).  In Heaven there will be no evil desires,
					and no corruption, and we will fully participate in the sinless perfection of God.  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 300-01.)
				</blockquote>
				I would follow up on that by citing <b>II Corinthians 5:21</b> and suggesting that although "innocence" can be deceived and/or coerced to
				sin, and having a sin nature (as we do) actually inclines us toward sin,  yet true "righteousness" <u>hates</u> sin.  In the context of
				Heaven we must remember that all the deception and glamour about sin will be removed.  We will see clearly what sin really was and will
				perceive its putrescence and its deadliness.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  With that understanding, fear of sin or disgust at sin would prevent us from ever being
				tempted to partake in it.  I think we will be horrified that we allowed it close to us at all.  Think of someone's reaction to the sudden
				appearance of a snake or spider in which he yells and runs away.  It is hard to imagine such a one getting cozy with a king cobra or a
				black widow, isn't it?  Or can you even stomach the idea of someone coming along after someone else has been sick and lapping up the vomit
				off the floor?  (Anyone feeling queasy?)  Just so sin, because of being revealed plainly for what it truly is, and with us being made truly
				righteous (not just innocent), it will be terrifying and repulsive to us.  And every time we see Jesus' scars we will be reminded of the
				price He paid on our behalf to redeem us from the consequences of our sin.  Because of His death on the cross to pay for our putrid and
				deadly sin, we will never have to be separated out of His universe and His presence.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  We can live forevermore in His kingdom in the kind of fellowship with Him and with
				others that He originally intended for us.  Sin will have been defeated and will hold no fascination for us anymore.  As we have said
				before in this study, we will be the best possible version of ourselves as human beings.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will now change the subject a little and go away from thinking about what we
				ourselves will be like in the kingdom of Heaven and instead think a little about what else may be there with us.  What do I mean?
				Well ... </font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Back to: <a href="heaven16.htm">Question 15</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven18.htm">Question 17</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 16: When we enter into the kingdom of Heaven, will there be animals there
				and, if so, is it possible we will be reunited with earthly pets?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a little on the lighter and more speculative side (at least the second part of
				the question is) but nevertheless one that I think is of great importance.  Why?  Because of the place that animals have in our daily
				lives here on earth right now.  It is impossible to imagine life without them ... literally.  So much of our food depends on the activity
				of animals (e.g., pollination) or is provided directly from them (e.g., milk, eggs, honey, meat, etc) and also clothing as well
				(cf. <b>Proverbs 27:26-27</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since this is a two-part question let's tackle the first (and easier) part before
				addressing the more speculative second portion.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think I can guess that most of us will respond to the matter of animals being in God's
				eternal kingdom with a resounding "Yes!"  But let's cite some scriptures just to confirm it: <b>Isaiah 11:6-9; Isaiah 65:25;
				Revelation 4:6-8</b> (Greek word translated "living creatures" is <i>zoon</i> which is everywhere else in NT translated "animal" --
				see Alcorn, <b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 378-79); <b>Revelation 19:11,14</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those verses of direct reference should be sufficient for us to answer fairly
				confidently that certainly there will be animals in Heaven.  But there are other indicators as well.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, there are clear instances where the Lord indicates His high regard for
				animals -- cf. <b>Genesis 6:18-20; Exodus 20:9-10; Proverbs 12:10; Jonah 4:11</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also see examples of God using animals to accomplish His will -- cf.
				<b>Numbers 22:27-33; I Kings 17:5-6;  Jonah 1:17; 2:10; Matthew 17:27</b>.  Essentially from the way God values and involves animals
				in His activities, it makes perfect sense that they will also be included in His kingdom.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To conclude, Randy Alcorn has an interesting comment about this matter:
				<blockquote>
					Adam, Noah, and Jesus are the three heads of the three Earths.  When Adam was created,  God surrounded him with animals.  When Noah
					was delivered from the flood, God surrounded him with animals.  When Jesus was born, God surrounded him with animals.  When Jesus
					establishes the renewed Earth, with renewed men and women, don't you think he'll surround himself with renewed animals?
					(<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 381.)
				</blockquote>
				Now let's think about whether you can expect to see Rover or Fluffy when we are ushered into the kingdom of Heaven. We explored what the
				Bible has to say about there being animals in the kingdom of Heaven on the New Earth.  We saw that it is extremely likely (almost certain)
				that there will be.  We will now focus on the second part of the question.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what do we think?  The quote from Alcorn we used above time had an interesting phrase.
				He used "renewed animals" in direct correlation with "renewed men and women." This implies a certain level of equality. What the second
				portion of the question is asking, in essence, is whether some animals will live again.  We don't usually think in those terms.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For it begs another question: "Do animals have souls like humans?"  I will not go into
			great depth but will simply point out two things:
			<ol>
				<li>
					While both the animals and Adam were formed "out of the ground," it is only said of Adam that God "breathed" life into him
					(cf. <b>Genesis 2:7, 19</b>) and that he was "made in the image of God" (cf. <b>Genesis 1:26-27</b>).
				</li>
				<li>
					A very notable essential difference is seen in the fact that God required shedding of blood from animals for certain offerings but
					He absolutely forbade any sort of human sacrifice.
				</li>
			</ol>
			Thus it seems there's a drastic difference in God's eyes in the relative value between animals and humans which leads us to conclude animals
			do not have souls in the sense that we think of as pertaining to humans.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While God highly values animals, as we saw last time, He placed mankind over His
				creation, thus the creation rises and falls with man.  When man fell, creation fell.  When man is finally and fully redeemed, so will
				the creation.(cf. <b>Romans 8:19-21</b>). Jesus did not die for animals which have no souls per se, but in redeeming man He is redeeming
				all creation.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If all this is true, why would we even suppose that certain specific animals might be
				raised again if they have no souls as such?  Again, we must stipulate that this has to be speculative.  But one reason to consider it is
				based on what we know about God's goodness.  On this subject, in his book Heaven, Randy Alcorn cites two authors:
				<blockquote>
					In her excellent book about Heaven, Joni Eareckson Tada says, "If God brings our pets back to life, it wouldn't surprise me.  It would
					be just like Him.  It would be totally in keeping with His generous character ... Exorbitant. Excessive. Extravagant in grace after
					grace. Of all the dazzling discoveries and ecstatic pleasures heaven will hold for us, the potential of seeing Scrappy would be pure
					whimsy -- utterly joyful, surprisingly superfluous. Heaven is going to be a place that will refract and reflect in as many ways as
					possible the goodness and joy of our great God, who delights in lavishing love on His children."  In a poem about the world to come,
					theologian John Piper writes,  "And as I knelt beside the brook, To drink eternal life, I took, A glance across the golden grass, And
					saw my dog, old Blackie, fast, As she could come. She leaped the stream -- Almost -- and what a happy gleam, Was in her eye. I knelt
					to drink, And I knew that I was on the brink, Of endless joy. And everywhere I turned I saw a wonder there." (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>,
					pp. 386-87)
				</blockquote>
				A couple of other questions about animals to consider: First, whatever animals are there, will they also experience a drastic rejuvenation?
				Let me once again quote Alcorn who cites John Wesley:
				<blockquote>
					Wesley explained mankind's appointed role on Earth and how the animals benefited from mankind's faithfulness to God and suffered in
					human rebellion: "Man was God's vice-regent  upon earth, the prince and governor of this lower world; and all the blessings of God
					flowed through him to the inferior creatures.  Man was the channel of conveyance between his Creator  and the whole brute creation
					... so when man made himself incapable of transmitting those blessings, that communication was necessarily cut off."  Wesley argued
					that animals originally had greater understanding, wills, passions, liberty, and choice ... Wesley envisioned a magnificent restoration
					of the animal kingdom on the New Earth. (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 388-89.)
				</blockquote>
				Eve's encounter with the serpent in <b>Genesis 3</b> may be seen as confirmation of Wesley's thought.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, what about extinct animals?  Will God restore them to the New Earth?  Might we
				see dinosaurs and interact with them?  Who knows?  But again, why not?  God did not originally intend for any kind of animal to die out or
				be slaughtered.  It makes sense that He would restore them.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since we have considered the idea of perhaps having a restored relationship with our
				earthly pets, let's consider the possibility of other kinds of relationships in Heaven.

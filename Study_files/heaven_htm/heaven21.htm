			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 20: Will Heaven afford the chance for us to achieve unfulfilled dreams or
				make up for missed opportunities?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So thinking of life right now, do "second chances" always come?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No.  Do they even come very often (for the big issues of life)?  Not really.  Why are they
				so rare?  Probably because, as that ungodly beer commercial used to proclaim, "You only go around once, so grab all the gusto you can!"
				Second chances don't often come because in this present life our time and our opportunities are <b>limited</b>.  For that reason, some people
				become despondent and even depressed as they come to realize that they will likely never have a second chance to rectify a situation where
				they chose badly.  They see that they have missed out on something that they deeply and profoundly desire to have in their lives.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Should a Christian feel that way?  I think not.  Why not?  For one thing, in this life, our
				God is the God of second chances.  He seeks after us and when we respond to Him He always accepts us  (<b>Luke 15 -- Jesus' parables of lost
				sheep, lost coin, and lost son</b>).  Healing from bad choices may be slow at times but it is possible through Jesus.  But even beyond those
				kinds of second chances in this life, there is an even greater answer: We who are believers don't just go around once, do we?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Followers of Jesus are promised a new and everlasting life on a New Earth.  Let's think
				about that for a moment.  What <b>is</b> life? Randy Alcorn comments on this:
				<blockquote>
					We use the term "eternal life" without thinking what it means.  "Life" is an earthly existence in which we work, rest, play and relate
					to each other in ways that include the cultivation and enjoyment of culture.  Yet we have redefined "eternal life" to mean an off-Earth
					existence stripped of the defining properties of what we know life to be.  Eternal life will be enjoying forever what life on Earth is
					at its finest moments, what it was intended to be.  Since in Heaven we'll finally experience life at its best, it would be more accurate
					to call our present existence the "beforelife" rather than what follows the "afterlife."  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 415.)
				</blockquote>
				Here is a reference to "Christoplatonism" referred to back in the early part of the study where we sometimes completely dissociate our
				existence in Heaven from the life we know now.  But if the word "life" that Jesus used in His promises means something similar to what
				it means to us now (but without the bad and evil) then we have much to look forward to in that life!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Considering the promise again, we have made many references throughout the study to the
				fact that our Heaven or the kingdom of God will, in fact, be on a new Earth.  Some may wonder about that or not accept that.  We defended
				the idea earlier but I want us to consider another proof from Scripture which ties in directly with our current question -- cf.
				<b>Matthew 5:3-5; Luke 6:20-23</b>.  If we are to receive the kingdom of heaven and the earth, it stands to reason that the kingdom of
				heaven is on the earth and that is where our primary, eternal home will be.  If we can accept that we begin to see Heaven in a context of
				life as we know it now.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But more to our question those Scriptures also point to the fact that Jesus promises more
				and better opportunities in the next life than we perhaps have experienced in this present life.  Or in other words, we will have "second
				chances."  I want to quote Alcorn extensively about that as we continue this discussion which should lighten the hearts of believers if we
				can become convinced it is true ...</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have discussed the idea that eternal life in Heaven should be seen as similar to our
				present life but purified and perfected.  We noted references to the Beatitudes from Jesus'  Sermon on the Mount in <b>Matthew 5</b> and
				<b>Luke 6</b>.  In them Jesus promises that those who are suffering from various issues now will be afforded better opportunities in His
				kingdom.  At this point I want to share an extended quotation from Randy Alcorn:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						I believe the New Earth will offer us opportunities we wished for but never had. God's original plan was that human beings would
						live happy and fulfilling lives on Earth.  If our current lives are our only chances at that, God's plan has been thwarted.
						Consider the injustice -- many honest, faithful people never got to live fulfilling lives, while some dishonest and unfaithful
						people seemed to fare much better.
					</p>
					<p>
						But God is not unjust, and this is <u>not</u> our only chance at life on Earth.  The doctrine of the New Earth clearly demonstrates
						that.  Do we have further biblical support for this? I believe we do, in the same passage we looked at earlier about laughter in
						Heaven.
					</p>
					<p>
						Luke the physician tells of a great number of people who came to Jesus "to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.  Those
						troubled by evil spirits were cured, and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing all"
						(<b>Luke 6:18-19</b>).  Consider what was going through Christ's mind as he dealt with these image-bearers plagued by sickness,
						poverty, and spiritual oppression.  He knew the world was full of people whom he wouldn't heal in this life.  He also knew that
						the same people he healed would one day grow weak again and die, leaving their families wailing over their graves.  What could
						Jesus say to such people? ... Jesus tells the hungry they'll be satisfied. Those whose eyes are swollen with tears will laugh.
						Those persecuted should leap for joy now.  Why?  because of their great reward in Heaven later. Where will Heaven be? ... Earth
						is the setting for God's ultimate comfort, for his reversal of life's injustices and tragedies.
					</p>
					<p>
						That's one reason I believe that on the New Earth [such people] will be able to experience much of what they didn't on the old
						Earth.  <u>God promises to make up for the heartbreaks of this earth.</u>
					</p>
					<p>
						Are you living with the disappointment of unfulfilled dreams?  In Heaven you'll find their fulfillment!  Did poverty, poor health,
						war or lack of time prevent you from pursuing and adventure or a dream?  Did you never get to finish that pile of books?  Good news.
						On the New Earth you will have a second chance to do what you dreamed of doing -- and far more besides ...
					</p>
					<p>
						We don't want to live as some other kind of creatures in some other world.  What we want is to be sinless, healthy people living
						on Earth, but without war, conflict, disease, disappointment, and death.  We want to live in the kind of world where our dreams,
						the deepest longings of our hearts, really do come true.
					</p>
					<p>
						That's exactly what God's Word promises us.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our failure to grasp this hurts us in countless ways.  We become discouraged, supposing that if we're handicapped, we'll never know
						the joy of running in a meadow or the pleasure of swimming.  Or if we aren't married -- or don't have a good marriage -- we'll never
						know the joy of marriage.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the New Earth, in perfect bodies, we'll run through meadows and swim in lakes.  We'll have the most exciting and fulfilling
						marriage there's ever been, a marriage so glorious and complete there will be no purpose for another.  Jesus himself will be our
						bridegroom!
					</p>
					<p>
						The smartest person God ever created in this world may never have learned to read because he or she had no opportunity.  The most
						musically gifted person may never have touched a musical instrument.  The greatest athlete may never have competed in a game.  The
						sport you're best at may be a sport you've never tried, your favorite hobby one you've never thought of.  Living under the Curse
						means we miss countless opportunities.  The reversing of the Curse, and the resurrection of our bodies and our Earth, mean we'll
						regain lost opportunities and inherit many more besides.  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, pp. 416-418)
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				In a sidebar on p. 417 Alcorn quotes Helen Keller:
				<blockquote>
					For three things I thank God every day of my life: thanks that he has vouchsafed me knowledge of His works; deep thanks that he has set
					in my darkness the lamp of faith; deep, deepest thanks that I have another life to look forward to -- a life joyous with light and
					flowers and heavenly song.
				</blockquote>
				It may be that some of the things we desire now will fade away as God changes us so that unholy carnality is removed.  But for those holy
				and proper desires we have missed because of the brokenness of the world, He will give a second chance.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have seen so far that because our eternal home, the New Earth, will be wonderfully
				perfect and  we will be given new bodies unrestrained by the effects of the Curse, there will be very little, if any, reason to regret the
				injustices of this present world and life.  We have also seen that an important aspect of the Beatitudes is Jesus' promise to make right
				what is wrong, and to replace bad experiences with good. We also saw that to those who missed opportunities because of the limitations of
				time or the vagaries of life circumstances, God may very well give them a second chance to fully experience the good which eluded them in
				this life.  We tempered this with the thought that much of what we value now in this life may be of little consequence at that time.  Thus
				some missed opportunities will no longer be relevant or worth pursuing.  The underlying thought in all of this is the concept of
				<b>"contentment"</b> (cf. <b>I Tim. 6:6</b>).  Feelings of anxiety and fear that time is running out and my "bucket list" is getting longer
				and longer are not of God.  For the Christian believer, this is not the only "go-around."  Since it is not -- <b>be content</b>.  Take
				advantage of the opportunities that the Lord and your life afford, enjoy your life, serve Him where you are, and don't worry about the
				things that time, money and circumstances do not allow you to experience.  One day these hindrances will be removed.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's one more thought about this I want us to explore with regard to this general
				question.  It has to do with that idea of having a change in perspective upon finally arriving in Heaven.  As disciples of Jesus and in
				the service of our Lord we are called to <b>"deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow Him"</b> (<b>Matthew 16:24</b>).  Jesus is
				talking about self-sacrifice in order to obey Him, do good, and serve others.  By definition this means we give up opportunities to do
				what we want (re: our normal human desires) and instead perform acts of service to Him and others.  So some missed opportunities for us
				to experience things we would enjoy  occur because Jesus requests it of us (perhaps "requires" is better). The question is: "Do you think
				we'll regret any such sacrifices we make when we're finally in God's kingdom?"</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think not.  Jesus speaks of this during and after the encounter with the rich, young
				ruler <b>Mark 10:21-31</b>. Note His promise to more than compensate any sacrifice made for His kingdom (though, in light of what He has
				done for us, it is less a sacrifice and more of an obligation on our part to respond to Him this way).  When we stand before Him I believe
				we'll rejoice at every instance of submission, sacrifice and suffering for the Kingdom that He observes in our lives.  Our perspective will
				be turned completely around.  One man compares this change of outlook to tax season.  During most of the year we rejoice over our income
				and wince at expenses.  But at tax time it's the opposite.  As we prepare our taxes we are less thrilled at the total income and rejoice
				over those expenses which result in deductions.  Just so, right now we are usually happiest when well-fed, well-rested, healthy and
				sufficiently engaged and amused by activities we enjoy.  We wince at being inconvenienced or when going through difficult circumstances
				like hunger, fatigue and hard work.  Sometimes we are compelled to endure unpleasant circumstances but we try to minimize them.  We do
				not (or rarely do we) choose them or invite them into our lives.  We may even avoid them when perhaps we should not for the sake of
				serving another.  And that is the point here.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am not saying it is the Lord's will for us to <b>seek out</b> suffering (as some do
				in an attempt to earn merit with God).  But are we at times willing to put ourselves aside, put up with an inconvenience, do what we
				don't really feel like doing, give up what we enjoy or crave, in order to be obedient to the Lord and show love to others?  If there are
				any real regrets in Heaven I believe it will be those opportunities we missed (or neglected) to sacrifice and serve Jesus.  Will such
				regret be eternal?  Perhaps these are a part of the tears that need wiping away (cf. <b>Revelation 21:4</b>) so that Jesus even in this
				shows grace to us in our immature, selfish, human lack of understanding.  It may be worth noting here that our spiritual growth and
				maturity at present will be shown in how little or much our values must change after our full redemption.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are winding down our study on Heaven.  With this next-to-last question I want to review
				and sort of consolidate some thoughts we have discussed at several different points in the study.

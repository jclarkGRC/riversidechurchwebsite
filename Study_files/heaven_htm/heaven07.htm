			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 6: Why is God going to preserve (or remake) the earth as our forever home?
				What's so important about it?  Why not dispose of it?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most people have the notion that those who are "worthy" (however that is accomplished)
				will leave the earth and live up there in Heaven forever with God because that is where God always has been and always will be (we have
				already seen those ideas are not true biblically).
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But within that mindset is the thought (perhaps unspoken) that the earth is not so very
				important since all its inhabitants will leave it eventually and spend eternity in either Heaven or Hell.
				<blockquote>
					NOTE:   Indeed, as a boy I knew that the earth would be burned up (<b>II Peter 3:10</b>) and God would make a "new heaven and a new
					earth" but nothing much was said about what purpose the new earth actually served because everyone assumed we would all be up in the
					new heaven!  Maybe we'd go visit it as a change of pace after all that harp playing?  Go see the animals?  Who knew?  So with that
					mindset, it's natural to wonder what the fuss over having a New Earth is all about.  Couldn't we be just as happy in another place
					and call it home? It turns out that the answer is "No".
				</blockquote>
				Two reasons: First, <b>God's original design</b> was <b>correct</b> to begin with (or as <b>Genesis 1</b> puts it, <b>"good"</b>).  There
				is no need to "go back to the drawing board" and start all over "from the ground up".  It just needs fixing -- consider <b>Matthew 19:27-28;
				Acts 3:21</b>.  The words "regeneration" and "restoration" (as well as other biblical words like reconcile, redeem, return, resurrect) all
				point to a putting back to what should be (original specifications) rather than completely obliterating and doing something else.  Linked to
				this idea of design is the issue of <b>compatibility</b>.  The earth was made for us and we were made to live on the earth. This is where we
				are most comfortable, where we fit the best.  It is our true home especially designed with us in mind.
				<blockquote>
					NOTE:  Consider how modern zoos design an enclosure for an animal by trying to mimic the animal's natural habitat instead of just
					providing a concrete box with steel bars as in the past.  Why?  Solely for its comfort. God's original plan was that we should live
					here on earth forever ... and He has not abandoned that plan, it seems.
				</blockquote>
				The second reason is <b>God's ownership deed</b> for the earth.  The earth belongs to the Lord and it has always been intended to glorify
				Him -- see <b>Psalm 24:1; Numbers 14:21</b>.  Satan and rebellious humans have tried to deny God's ownership and subvert the glory that
				it brings Him but they will ultimately fail because the Lord has not renounced His claim on it.  It is His will to have it back in its
				proper state and rightful condition performing its intended purpose -- see <b>Romans 8:19-21</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We understand those feelings as the image bearers of God.  When something of ours is
				illicitly taken from us or is lost, we try to reclaim it if possible.  It bothers us when we cannot.  When something is not doing what
				it should be doing, we try to fix it if we can.  It is frustrating if we cannot get it to work right.  Just so, God will not allow what
				is His to be lost or broken forever.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is apparent, then, that we would never be as happy anywhere else.  The earth (new
				and remade) is and will be our forever home as ordained and designed by God from the beginning.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What will that restored earth be like?  We have seen that the earth is important because
				it was God's original design that it be our forever home.  Because of that and because it belongs to Him, the Lord is not willing to abandon
				it or destroy it.  Instead He will remake, or perhaps, restore it to its original specifications so that it will truly be "Heaven on earth".

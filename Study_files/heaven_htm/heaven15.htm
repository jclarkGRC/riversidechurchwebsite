			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven16.htm">Question 15</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 14: When we enter the kingdom of Heaven, what will we know; will we still
				have to learn; and how would that happen?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some have asserted that upon being transformed and entering Heaven we will easily grasp
				all mysteries which have eluded us previously.  In other words, we will know everything.  The assumption seems to be that God will simply
				bestow all this knowledge upon us without any effort on our part (maybe like the movie Matrix where they simply downloaded any needed
				knowledge and skills directly into a person's brain?).  Is this true scripturally? Some use <b>I Corinthians 13:12</b> to affirm it.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to scholars, "know fully" (NIV) is the translation from the Greek "epiginosko"
				which, when used of humans, does not speak of having all knowledge available.  Rather it refers to the issue of accuracy.  The verse makes
				reference to an ancient bronze "mirror" which can let you see yourself somewhat but not very clearly.  There is distortion in the reflection.
				Paul is saying that all distortions  and inaccuracies will be removed.  Randy Alcorn cites Wayne Grudem's <b><i>Systematic Theology</i></b>:
				<blockquote>
					<b>1 Cor. 13:12</b> does not say that we will be omniscient or know everything or know everything (Paul could have said we will know
					all things, <i>"ta panta"</i>, if he had wished to do so), but, rightly translated, simply says that we will know in a fuller or more
					intensive way, "even as we have been known", that is, without any error or misconceptions in our knowledge.
					(<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 305.)
				</blockquote>
				This interpretation makes sense when you realize that Paul is making this statement in the larger context of the Corinthian Christians'
				lack of insight regarding the best way to exercise spiritual gifts, which is from an attitude of love and service toward others rather
				than seeking self-glorification.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some argue, however, that not having all knowledge would constitute an imperfection or
				a flaw in our make-up.  Since in heaven everything is supposed to be "perfect", isn't that a problem?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No, not having all knowledge at our disposal is not a problem to the perfection of heaven.
				If we go back once more to Eden we see that obviously Adam and Eve didn't have all knowledge even though they were created without
				imperfection and were placed in a perfect ("good") environment -- cf. <b>Genesis 3:5,7,11</b>.  Another thought about that is that the
				holy angels, who are sinless we presume and operate directly in God's presence also do not know everything -- cf. <b>I Peter 1:12</b>.
				Not having all knowledge is not a flaw at all -- it  is simply a proper aspect of humans being finite rather than infinite.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have started to explore the idea of what our knowledge might be like in Heaven and
				concluded, based on what we could see from the Bible and logical deduction, that it seems unlikely that God will simply pour absolute
				knowledge of all things into our heads when we enter His kingdom. Does that mean we will still be learning as we do now?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some perhaps resist the idea that we will continue to go through a learning process in Heaven because,
				to them, "learning" is strongly associated with unpleasant things like: school, homework, writing papers, tedious drills, boring lectures
				-- none of which fit with our usual ideas of Heavenly activities.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>BUT</b> the same people who hated formal schooling no doubt loved other kinds of
				learning like figuring out how things work, developing outdoors or sport skills, learning how to grow flowers and vegetables, or how to
				create things out of wood or metal or cloth.  All knowledge and skills come through a learning process of some sort.  But different people
				enjoy learning in different ways.  Some actually <b>do</b> like books and lectures (believe it or not), but others prefer hands-on, trial
				and error, practical and experiential learning.  Most of all, absolutely everyone enjoys learning about subjects which interest them or
				about activities they enjoy.  I believe that in Heaven learning will be a pleasure because it will primarily, if not always, be about
				getting answers and information to that which truly intrigues us, satisfies our curiosity or contributes to developing a desired skill.
				But it is a <b>process</b> not a download dump -- cf. <b>Ephesians 2:6-7</b>, and note that we are <b>"shown in the ages to come"</b>
				about Jesus' grace to us.  That's probably just how we will learn any new knowledge we receive in Heaven -- over the course of time --
				just as we learn now.
				<blockquote>
					SIDE QUESTION:  Will everyone eventually be equal in their skills or expertise in all the fields of knowledge in Heaven?
				</blockquote>
				With all eternity and unlimited resources to hone and perfect our knowledge and abilities, an individual could no doubt become expert in
				as many areas as he desired.  But that is just the point -- your desires will very likely limit your pursuits.  Remembering the principle
				of continuity we have talked about, since you will still be you, it is likely that many of your likes, dislikes and areas of interest will
				stay constant.  Obviously the capacity to grow personally and develop new areas of interest are enormously enhanced by the fact that now
				our time and resources are indeed unlimited.  But still it is likely that some things just won't pique your imagination.  Also, remembering
				the principle of diversity we have discussed, it does not seem the Lord really wants us all to be the same -- equally adept at everything.
				Rather it seems He relishes the fact that we, all being very different, pursue different fields with varying levels of passion.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we're learning what we want to learn, but given that we probably will limit ourselves
				to certain fields of interest, (or even if we don't) given that we have an infinite amount of time and no other limitations (except our own
				finiteness), will we eventually discover all that we can (or want to) and then we start saying the terrible thing all parents hate to hear
				from their children: "I'm booorrreed...."?  Is it possible?  I liked what Louis C.K. (a writer and actor) says about this:
				<blockquote>
					"I'm bored" is a useless thing to say. You live in a great, big, vast world that you've seen "none percent" of.  Even the inside of your
					own mind is endless.  The fact that you're alive is amazing. So you don't get to say "I'm bored". (unreferenced quote, Louis C.K.)
				</blockquote>
				The idea that we can become bored implies that not only are we finite but that God is, too.  It assumes that He is finished creating new
				things and we have no warrant to think tha t- -cf. <b>Revelation 21:5</b>.  The Greek for <b>"I make"</b> is linear, which simply means
				it is ongoing or really means <b>"I am making"</b>.   If we have not even fully explored our own minds, not to mention our world (per the
				quote above) -- what about the universe?  And never mind that it looks like God is still making more new stuff!  For that matter what
				about learning more about God Himself!  Who is He and how does He exist and so many unanswered questions about Him (which He may or may
				not decide to give out the information and could we even understand it if He did?).  I don't think we have to worry about running out of
				things to discover so that life becomes stagnant in God's kingdom.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last consideration about all this: How will we learn new things in Heaven?  Will we
				have personal tutors (maybe the guardian angels who watched over us on earth)?  Will there be classes offered by some of humanity's best
				and most qualified experts and thinkers in a particular given field (e.g., Isaac Newton, George Washington Carver, C. S. Lewis, etc.)?
				Think of the conversations about historic events which could be had with those who were actually there in the moment!  Will there be
				books to read and study in Heaven?  Well we know for sure there is at least some books in Heaven -- cf. <b>Revelation 20:12</b>.  I
				think we should also expect the Bible to be there -- cf. <b>Psalm 119:89</b>. Perhaps other worthy books which honored God will survive
				or be revised.  Some of those in Heaven were authors so it seems logical that many of them will continue to write down their experiences
				and thoughts for others to share.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course much of this is speculation from this side of Heaven.  Though I think the
				events and heroes of this present earth will be remembered because the Lord promises rewards for those who are faithful now. I can't
				help but wonder if this present time will become much less important in view of what lies ahead for those entering into God's eternal
				kingdom.  With the wonders of a completely restored planet in front of us (who are also completely restored to what God originally
				intended us to be) will we care very much about the history and struggles and lessons of our former, broken home?  Or will we focus
				mainly on our new world and new home and begin to tour it excitedly?  I submit most of our learning will result from personal exploration
				and new experiences in a remade, perfect universe.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have considered how we will be changed when we enter the kingdom of Heaven --
				physically, mentally, emotions and personality traits, and so on.  Our next question continues that trend.</font></p>

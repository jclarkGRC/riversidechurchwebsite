			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Back to: <a href="heaven17.htm">Quesstion 16</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="heaven19.htm">Question 18</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Question 17: What kinds of relationships can we perhaps look forward to in
				Heaven?"</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First and foremost, what will be the primary relationship we'll  have in Heaven? See
				<b>Matthew 9:14-15; Ephesians 5:30-32; Revelation 19:7-9</b> which make reference to a picture of Jesus as the Bridegroom and the church
				as the Bride.  See also <b>Revelation 22:13</b> which portrays Jesus as the all-sufficient one who can meet all our needs including our
				need for personal interaction and relationship.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If that is true then will we even <u>want</u> to participate in other lesser
				relationships?  Randy Alcorn cites protestant reformer and theologian John Calvin:
				<blockquote>
					To be in Paradise and live with God is not to speak to each other and be heard by each other, but is only to enjoy God, to feel his
					good will, and rest in him."  (<b><i>Heaven</i></b>, p. 328.)
				</blockquote>
				We have thoughts about that, perhaps? And further, should we even have such desires?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some point to <b>Psalm 73:25</b> to say "No" and insist that we will and should only want
				to interact with the Lord.  And if we do wish to have other interpersonal relationships in Heaven then it reflects our carnality.  However,
				the context of <b>Psalm 73</b> is that of Asaph coming to grips with the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous here
				on earth. Then as he sees the truth, he understands he does not need riches, rather he needs only God.  Thus the Lord holds the primary
				place in his life.  So the psalm is a repudiation of bad thinking about the temporal versus the eternal, not a view of how relationships
				will function in Heaven.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To try to answer this question about whether we will have or want other relationships in
				Heaven beyond the one we will have with the Lord, we should probably do as we have before and consider God's original design -- see
				<b>Genesis 2:18</b>.  Think of the situation: Adam was in a perfect environment with the Lord Himself for company and yet God said it wasn't
				good for Adam to not have the company of someone else like himself. That leads naturally to another consideration of things we have covered,
				namely about our design and what that may mean for how we'll function in Heaven.  Will we eat in Heaven as Adam and Eve did before the Fall?
				Seems likely.  Will we continue to learn in heaven?  Seems very probable. God designed us that way.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Will we continue to crave human companionship in Heaven?  It seems God also hard wired that
				into us as well.  These things are not evil.  Eating does not have to become gluttony and neither does desiring human interaction have to
				become idolatry or a distraction from the Lord.  Even here on earth it is often true that some relationships encourage people toward God,
				not away from Him.  Just as human parents are glad when their children all get along, so it seems God our Heavenly Father enjoys it when
				His children are close and in unity with each other.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the principle of continuity also means that we will have our memories from our earthly
				lives (as we earlier concluded) and that we are recognizable by those who knew us (we will be ourselves), it also suggests that our old
				earth relationships with other believers will continue into the New Earth.  Many are looking forward to grand reunions -- see
				<b>I Thess. 4:13-14, 17-18</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that we have seen that we will almost certainly have interpersonal human relationships
				simply because that seems to be something the Lord thinks is "good" and it is part of our fundamental design, perhaps we should consider
				what forms these relationships take.  In other words, will they resemble the kinds of relationships we have here and now on earth or will
				they take on a new look and be very different in Heaven?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have established that, though our primary and most fulfilling relationship in the New
				Earth will be with Jesus Himself, yet because of God's design we will, in all likelihood, also desire interpersonal relationships with other
				human believers.  We also saw that since we go to Heaven as ourselves with memories and personalities intact, it makes sense that our
				relationships will extend and continue in the kingdom of God.  However that leads to the next question ...

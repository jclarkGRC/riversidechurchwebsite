				exact same storyline but the genre of Scientology 'theology' (if we can call it that) is exactly the same as <i>Star Wars</i> or <i>Star
				Trek</i> or <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> or ... well, you get the picture.  It's a work of science-fiction.  (By the way, did I mention
				that L. Ron Hubbard was an accomplished and successful science-fiction writer for many years?)  Do you  find it hard to believe that an
				entire religion can be built on a such a foundation?  Well, consider the following information from a leaflet written by Roland
				Rashleigh-Berry, a former Scientologist, which summarizes the underlying reason people supposedly need Dianetic auditing and then decide
				for yourself.  This material is made available from the webmaster of
				<a href="http://www.xenu.net">www.xenu.net</a> to download, print and distribute in pamphlet form as a means of spreading the truth about
				Scientology.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
				<blockquote>
					I'm going to tell you a story. Are you sitting comfortably? Right, then I'll begin.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Once upon a time (75 million years ago to be more precise) there was an alien galactic ruler named Xenu. Xenu was in charge of all
					the planets in this part of the galaxy</i> [note: the Galactic Confederacy]  <i>including our own planet Earth, except in those days it
					was called Teegeeack. Now Xenu had a problem. All of the 76 planets he controlled were overpopulated. Each planet had on average 178
					billion people. He wanted to get rid of all the overpopulation so he had a plan</i>.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Xenu took over complete control with the help of renegades to defeat the good people and the Loyal Officers. Then with the help of
					psychiatrists he called in billions of people for income tax inspections where they were instead given injections of alcohol and
					glycol mixed to paralyze them. Then they were put into space planes that looked exactly like DC8s (except they had rocket motors
					instead of propellers).</i>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>These DC8 space planes then flew to planet Earth where the paralysed people were stacked around the bases of volcanoes in their
					hundreds of billions. When they had finished stacking them around then H-bombs were lowered into the volcanoes. Xenu then detonated
					all the H-bombs at the same time and everyone was killed.</i>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>The story doesn't end there though. Since everyone has a soul (called a "thetan" in this story) then you have to trick souls into
					not coming back again. So while the hundreds of billions of souls were being blown around by the nuclear winds he had special
					electronic traps that caught all the souls in electronic beams (the electronic beams were sticky like fly-paper).</i>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>After he had captured all these souls he had them packed into boxes and taken to a few huge cinemas. There all the souls had to
					spend days watching special 3D motion pictures that told them what life should be like and many confusing things. In this film they
					were shown false pictures and told they were God, The Devil and Christ. In the story this process is called "implanting".</i>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>When the films ended and the souls left the cinema these souls started to stick together because since they had all seen the same
					film they thought they were the same people. They clustered in groups of a few thousand. Now because there were only a few living
					bodies left they stayed as clusters and inhabited these bodies.</i>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>As for Xenu, the Loyal Officers finally overthrew him and they locked him away in a mountain on one of the planets. He is kept in by
					a force-field powered by an eternal battery and Xenu is still alive today.</i>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					That is the end of the story. And so today everyone is full of these clusters of souls called "body thetans". And if we are to be a
					free soul then we have to remove all these "body thetans" and pay lots of money to do so. And the only reason people believe in God
					and Christ was because it was in the film their body thetans saw 75 million years ago.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Well what did you think of that story?  What? You thought it was a <i>stupid</i> story? <i>Well so do we</i>. However, this story is
					the core belief in the religion known as Scientology. If people knew about this story then most people would never get involved in it.
					This story is told to you when you reach one of their secret levels called OT III. After that you are supposed to telepathically
					communicate with these body thetans to make them go away. You have to pay a lot of money to get to this level and do this (or you
					have to work very hard for the organisation on extremely low pay for many years). We are telling you this story as a warning. If
					you become involved with Scientology then we would like you to do so with your eyes open and fully aware of the sort of material it
					contains.  Now you have read this you know their big secret. Don't let us put you off joining though.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">See what I mean about it being a wild sci-fi story?  And besides that, it's not even
				good science-fiction by today's standards.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bait and switch tactics</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the pamphlet related, the information we now know is not shared with potential
				recruits at first (much as Mormons do not start out by telling people that one day they can possibly each be a god with their own
				world to rule).  Most people would recognize the fantastic nature of such a crazy story.  In fact the author of the pamphlet,
				Rashleigh-Berry, was an avid Scientologist until he reached the level OT III mentioned in the text and heard the story about Xenu.  D
				isgusted, he immediately quit and made it one of his goals to reveal the sham for what it was, hence, his  writing and publication of
				the Xenu leaflet (<a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/leaflet/#comments">www.xenu.net/archive/leaflet/#comments</a>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what attracted him in the first place and what attracts many others to read
				Dianetics and to consider getting involved with the Scientology religion and its processes?  The answer is that Scientology uses a
				carrot -- a powerful and intriguing carrot.  Scientology tells people that they <b>can</b> be happy (e.g., <i>Scientology: A New Slant on
				Life</i> chapter one is entitled '<i>Is It Possible to Be Happy?</i>' ).  Who wouldn't want to be happy?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, this happiness is entirely within the capabilities of any person to attain
				for himself.  The idea of self-sufficiency and self-improvement appeals to many.  In the just referenced Scientology book, Hubbard is
				quoted just before the table of contents:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The human mind is capable of resolving the problem of the human mind.</i>
				</blockquote>
				And from the introductory guide What is Scientology? we are informed that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Although modern life seems to pose an infinitely complex array of problems, Scientology maintains that the solutions to those
					problems are basically simple and within every man's reach. Difficulties with communication and interpersonal relationships,
					nagging insecurities, self-doubt and despair -- each man innately possesses the potential to be free of these and many other
					concerns.</i> (p. 59)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is also a constant and confident insistence on their part that Scientology is
				new, that it really works and that it is the only thing that does really work.  In a 1967 journal entry Hubbard writes:
				<blockquote>
					In all the broad universe there is no other hope for Man than ourselves.
				</blockquote>
				These kinds of assertions can be persuasive when from a true believer.  For instance, look up Tom Cruise's testimonial interview on
				<i>YouTube</i> sometime when you feel like having a good laugh (or maybe a good fright).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Man's basic drive</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As mentioned earlier, Hubbard did not start out by telling people about Xenu, the
				tyrannical galactic overlord.  In point of fact he could not have done so since the best evidence suggests this information was not
				'discovered' by him until 1967.  On the other hand the book which launched this entire movement, <i>Dianetics: The Modern Science of
				Mental Health</i>, was completed in 1950.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That book (and subsequent works) makes several 'bold' assertions while at the same
				time admitting that the basic ideas are not new.  It is the nuance or the twist that Hubbard gives to each idea which makes it unique,
				new and groundbreaking.  For instance, in the book Hubbard reveals that man is a spiritual being.  While admitting that other
				philosophies and religions have likewise asserted this, he contrasts Dianetics (and eventually Scientology) with modern science which
				declares man's mind to be just a "<i>a collection of cells and neurons</i>" (<i>What is Scientology?</i>, p. 60) and which says that
				man himself is just flesh or "<i>mud</i>" (Personal interview with Hubbard in 1966 published on video as <i>An Introduction to
				Scientology</i>).  He then calls each spirit a <i><b>thetan</b></i> which wears and uses a mind and body.  Thus the individual is
				ultimately and essentially the thetan while the mind and body are tools for his/her/it's use.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What it uses them for is <b>survival</b> (another marvelous insight on his part).
				Once again it is conceded that this is not a brand new idea but what differentiates Hubbard's contention is that he says that <b>all</b>
				of man's activities can be linked or related to this <b>one</b> primary, supreme and overriding goal to "<i>SURVIVE!</i>" (<i>What is
				Scientology?</i>, p. 60.) This drive to survive is not limited to just staying alive but is concerned with doing so on as high a level
				as possible. Thus Hubbard lays out what eventually became known as the <i>Eight Dynamics</i> which enumerate and describe what mankind's o
				ptimal survival looks like.  The first four were presented in <i>Dianetics</i> while the rest were developed after Hubbard turned the
				dianetic process into the religion of Scientology.  They are as follows:
				<ol>
					<li>
						The dynamic of SELF -- your own individual survival.
					</li>
					<li>
						The dynamic of CREATIVITY -- has to do with leaving a legacy through family and children.
					</li>
					<li>
						The dynamic of GROUP SURVIVAL -- being part of a larger community (school, work, etc.).
					</li>
					<li>
						The dynamic of SPECIES -- being part of the human race.
					</li>
					<li>
						The dynamic of LIFE FORMS -- all life on earth not just humanity.
					</li>
					<li>
						The dynamic of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE -- the desire of the universe to survive.
					</li>
					<li>
						The dynamic of SPIRITUAL -- the survival of 'being,' i.e., life force itself.
					</li>
					<li>
						The dynamic of INFINITY -- the urge to having an eternal, infinite existence. (Ibid., pp. 70-71.)
					</li>
				</ol>
				The goal is to be proficiently surviving in all dynamics simultaneously.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Man's basic problem</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, according to Hubbard, most men and women have a hang-up which hinders them
				from these optimal levels of survival.  The problem is rooted in the fact that mankind, in general, does not know himself.  Man does
				not understand that the adverse aspects of life are caused in large part by what is happening in and through the mind. Such things as
				negative "<i>emotions, irrational fears and psychosomatic illnesses</i>" are "<i>most accurately described as what the soul is doing to
				the body through the mind</i>". (Ibid., p. 60.)  Thus the word '<i>dianetics</i>' was coined from Greek '<i>dia</i>' meaning
				'<i>through</i>' and '<i>nous</i>' meaning '<i>mind</i>'. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Hubbard the mind records every detail of every moment of life using mental
				image pictures and puts it on a '<i>time track</i>' which is likened to a motion picture film.  His 'breakthrough' was that he 'discovered'
				that the mind consists of two parts: <i>analytical</i> and <i>reactive</i>. The analytical mind is that part which observes, records
				consciously, reasons, and resolves problems.  It loads information into '<i>standard memory banks ... and uses the data to make decisions
				that promote survival</i>' (or, in other words, a better life).  (Ibid., p. 63)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is one major exception to the recordings made by the analytical mind according
				to Hubbard's theory, which is, that in moments of extreme duress the reactive mind supersedes the analytical mind. The reactive mind
				(or subconscious) is cruder and less logical than the analytical mind but it is very sturdy and up to the task of handling the painful
				moments of life.  It still records in perfect detail everything that is happening but stores the information in separate memory banks
				which cannot be readily accessed by the analytical (or conscious) mind.  These painful, unpleasant mental images are called <i>engrams</i>.
				It is the presence of engrams in man which hinders him from attaining his highest and best survival status.  In short, engrams are the
				source of all our problems.  How so?  Read on.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The evil which 'engrams' engender</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because the recordings made by the mind are so precise, when a traumatic event occurs
				all the surrounding details are included.  So in the engram all sounds, smells, tastes, faces, activity, etc. are remembered.  But
				because the reactive mind is so much less sophisticated than the analytical mind it equates these other, mostly neutral details as
				being part of the negative episode.  For instance, a person is out driving and has a bad automobile accident which injures him.  In
				the background is the sound of a jackhammer, in the air is the smell of a nearby fast food restaurant, up close are the excited voices
				of some Hispanics rushing to help, speaking Spanish, and blinking over the whole scene is a bright flashing neon light.  At the moment
				of the accident, the reactive mind takes over and records all these things and more and buries it all deep in the subconscious.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The idea of Dianetics is that at a later point in time that same person may hear a
				jackhammer or hear someone speaking Spanish excitedly or smell the same fast food or see a bright flashing light and experience extreme
				nervousness or feel out of control or even feel the pain of the now healed injury.  This reawakening of the old engram is called
				<i>restimulation</i>.  The reactive mind, being so crude and illogical, has connected all those other irrelevant factors to the accident
				and injury and in the moment of hearing, smelling or seeing similar things immediately takes over and tries to steer the person away
				from what it views as a another threatening situation by bringing up the old bad feelings.  These negative feelings or emotions  are
				referred to as <i>commands</i>.  The person has no choice in the matter of what he is  currently experiencing as a result of these
				activating, embedded memories.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reactive mind is, in its own way, also trying to facilitate survival but it is
				now a hindrance rather than a help.  It causes the person to act irrationally or, as Dianetics puts it, he is in a state of
				<i>aberration</i> (wandering from a straight path or line).  The person is not aware of how he is being affected in this way, it is all
				done on a subconscious level.  In fact his analytical mind actually begins to try to supply an explanation for the sudden onset of these
				feelings, anxieties, or even physical pain.  This is called '<i>justified thought</i>' by Hubbard.
				<blockquote>
					<b>NOTE:</b>  In the 2010 DVD <i>How to Use Dianetics</i> it is asserted that in the lower forms of life this function of the
					reactive mind is still a valuable trait but in humans it has outlasted its usefulness.  We've come a long way, baby!
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point, according to Hubbard, is that all our issues in all areas of life come
				directly or indirectly from the presence of engrams.  We do not know when they were created (some were perhaps formed while we were
				still in the womb).  We do not have any idea how detrimental they are.  We do not even realize they are there.  And we have no
				conception of how good life can be without them.
				<blockquote>
					<b>NOTE:</b>  One comparison used by Hubbard is that someone who has no engrams can be compared to a normal person to the same
					degree that the normal person can be compared to someone who is clinically insane.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A ‘clear’ solution</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to L. Ron Hubbard, the answer to these terrible '<i>engrams</i>' (subconscious
				memories of negative experiences) and their adverse effects on a person's '<i>survival</i>' (quality of life) is to erase them or
				eliminate them from the mind completely.  When a person reaches this state (referred to as '<i><b>clear</b></i>') amazing things begin
				to happen.  For the first time he is able to operate at the levels of which he is capable.  This is no mere small step of improvement
				in a single characteristic, natural ability, or acquired skill but, rather, it is a profound enormous leap of dramatic change on all
				levels of existence.  Am I overstating their claims?  Consider the following quotations which come from various works by Hubbard but
				which I gathered at <a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/5.htm">http://www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/5.htm</a>:
				<blockquote>
					<i>You are only three or four hours from taking your glasses off for keeps.</i>  - L. Ron Hubbard,   Eyesight and Glasses, Dianetic
					Auditor's Bulletin, Vol. 2, No. 7, January, 1952.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>This [Scientology] is useful knowledge. With it the blind again see, the lame walk, the ill recover, the insane become sane and the
					sane become saner. By its use the thousand abilities  Man has sought to recover become his once more.</i>  - L. Ron Hubbard,
					Scientology: A History of Man, 1952.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Of all the ills of man which can be successfully processed by Scientology, arthritis ranks near the top. In skilled hands, this
					ailment, though misunderstood and dreaded in the past, already has begun to become history. Twenty-five hours of Scientology by
					an auditor who fairly understands how to process arthritis can be said to produce an invariable alleviation of the condition. Some
					cases, even severe ones, have responded in as little as two hours of processing, according to reports from auditors in the
					field.</i>  - L. Ron Hubbard, "Journal of Scientology," Issue 1-G, 1952.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Leukaemia is evidently psychosomatic in origin and at least eight cases of leukaemia had been treated successfully by Dianetics
					after medicine had traditionally given up. The source of leukaemia has been reported to be an engram containing the phrase 'It
					turns my blood to water.</i>'  - L. Ron Hubbard, "Journal of Scientology," Issue 15-G, 1953.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Scientology is the only specific (cure) for radiation (atomic bomb) burns.</i>  - L. Ron Hubbard, <i>All About Radiation</i>,
					1957, p. 109.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>The alleviation of the condition of insanity has also been accomplished now ...</i>  - L. Ron Hubbard, Hubbard Communications
					Office Bulletin, November 1970, <i>Psychosis</i>.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Arthritis vanishes, myopia gets better, heart illness decreases, asthma disappears, stomachs function properly and the whole
					catalogue of illnesses goes away and stays away.</i>  - L. Ron  Hubbard, Dianetics: <i>The Modern Science of Mental Health</i>,
					1987 Ed., p. 72.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To further illustrate their view, let us see a sidebar in the basic guidebook <i>What
				is Scientology?</i> (1993 ed., p. 65) which sheds light on the remarkable benefits of pursuing the dianetic process until the state of
				<b>clear</b> is attained:</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
				<blockquote>
					<b>The Attributes of Clear</b>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Clear is a state that has never before been attainable in man's history.  A Clear possesses attributes, fundamental and inherent
					but not always available in an uncleared state, which have not been suspected of man and are not included in past discussions of
					his abilities and behavior.  The Clear is:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Freed from active or potential psychosomatic illness or aberration
						</li>
						<li>
							Self-determined
						</li>
						<li>
							Vigorous and persistent
						</li>
						<li>
							Unrepressed
						</li>
						<li>
							Able to perceive, recall, imagine, create and compute at a level high above the norm
							<blockquote>
								<b>NOTE:</b>  Hubbard believed that the analytical mind never makes mistakes.  It is only the presence of engrams
								in the reactive mind which causes errors to be made because bad data is being input into the '<i>machine</i>'.  Thus,
								eliminating the bad data will result in a smoothly functioning and error-free existence. (<i>Dianetics</i>, pp.52-3)
							</blockquote>
						</li>
						<li>
							Stable mentally
						</li>
						<li>
							Free with his emotion
						</li>
						<li>
							Able to enjoy life
						</li>
						<li>
							Freer from accidents
						</li>
						<li>
							Healthier
						</li>
						<li>
							Able to reason swiftly
						</li>
						<li>
							Able to react quickly
						</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Happiness is important.  The ability to arrange life and the environment so that living can be better enjoyed, the ability to
					tolerate the foibles of one's fellow humans, the ability to see the true factors in a situation and resolve problems of living
					with accuracy, the ability to accept and execute responsibility, these things are important.  Life is not much worth living if
					it cannot be enjoyed.  The Clear enjoys living to a very full extent.  He can stand up to situations which, before he was
					cleared, would have reduced him to a shambles.  The ability to live well and fully and enjoy that living is the gift of Clear.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b> In <i>Dianetics</i> (2007 ed., p 49) it is stated that "<i>The reward
				of survival activity is pleasure.</i>"  It seems that a major underlying thought of Scientology is that without pleasure life is
				pointless and worthless.  This can be related directly back to the self-centered ideology of Hubbard's occultic background and his
				being a megalomaniac.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How to get 'Clear'</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But how is it done?  How can a person get rid of those pesky engrams which are the source
				of all the problems in life?  Simple ... go through dianetic processing,  also called <b>auditing</b>.  What is <i>that</i>, you
				say?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is essentially when a person who believes he needs help to get rid of his reactive
				mind experiences (who are called <i><b>preclears</b></i>) allows himself to be led through those negative memories.  After completely
				revealing them, the theory is that he becomes more aware of his own identity and true nature and then, with the help of the auditor who
				provides extra <i>dynamic thrust</i> (mental/emotional/spiritual force?), these engrams are <i><b>canceled</b></i>.  What does that look
				and sound like?  The auditor asks questions or gives commands -- sometimes to get him to come to a realization which becomes more or less
				automatic; or perhaps to lead the preclear to recount in detail those bad experiences.  Perhaps the best way to demonstrate is to read
				from two Scientology publications, guidebooks which accompany DVD presentations -- <i>Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought</i> (pp.
				15-16) and <i>How to Use Dianetics</i> (pp. 13-26).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hubbard and Scientology are on record as being very critical of psychologists,
				psychiatrists, psychoanalysts and the like:
				<blockquote>
					(e.g., <i>A psychiatrist today has the power to
					<ol>
						<li>
							take a fancy to a woman
						</li>
						<li>
							lead her to take wild treatment as a joke
						</li>
						<li>
							drug and shock her to temporary insanity
						</li>
						<li>
							incarnate [sic] her
						</li>
						<li>
							use her sexually
						</li>
						<li>
							sterilise her to prevent conception
						</li>
						<li>
							kill her by a brain operation to prevent disclosure.
						</li>
					</ol>
					And all with no fear of reprisal. Yet it is rape and murder ... We want at least one bad mark on every psychiatrist in England, a
					murder, an assault, or a rape or more than one ...  This is Project Psychiatry. We will remove them.</i> - L. Ron Hubbard, Sec ED,
					Office of LRH, Confidential, 22 February 1966, "Project Psychiatry.")
				</blockquote>
				It seems, however, like they use very similar techniques in their auditing process.  Most of the time, if not always, an
				IB (a type of lie detector), also known as the Hubbard Electrometer or E-meter, is used.  This gadget allegedly
				<blockquote>
					<i>measures the mental state or change of state of a person, helping the auditor and preclear locate areas of spiritual distress or
					travail so they can be addressed and handled.</i> (What is Scientology?, p. 83 picture caption)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scientology promises that these methods work without exception because they are
				"<i>built upon the fundamental truths of life</i>," and are "<i>real tools</i>" which "<i>[do] not depend upon a system of beliefs or
				faith</i>" (<i>What is Scientology</i>, p. 59).  The methods must merely be applied and they are bound to produce results.  However,
				it should be noted that Scientology insists that only the exact questions from the program Hubbard has developed will yield the proper
				results (<i>What is Scientology?</i>, p. 80).  Nothing else will do the job.   (Is that a monopoly on happiness I smell?)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Research?  We don't need no stinking research!</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The precise nature and exacting methodology of auditing required must be due to a
				long, intensive and exhausting investigation by Hubbard into the depths of man's mind, soul and spirit.  It stands to reason that L.
				Ron left no stone unturned as he developed his theories.  Is that true?  Not according to his son, L. Ron, Jr. who was right there
				with him when it all got started.  In a previously referenced  interview with a certain magazine, we see the following exchange:
				<blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Interviewer:</b> <i>Did he write the book off the top of his head? Did he do any real research?</i>

							<b>L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.:</b> <i>No research at all. When he has answered that question over the years, his answer has changed

				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One article detailing a brief history of Scientology agrees with Jr.'s allegation by
				asserting that he simply plagiarized other sources and that Dianetics is an amalgamation of ... "... <i>hypnotic techniques, Freudian
				theories, Buddhist concepts and elements of other philosophies and practices</i>".
				(<a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/8.htm">www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/8.htm</a>)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It further states that despite requests Hubbard never produced any copies of research
				protocol to lend verification to his theories.  How can this be?!  This is soooo disappointing!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>New developments</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we have seen, Hubbard made some pretty bold claims for what Dianetic auditing will
				do for a person, in essence it will make his life perfect.  However, that did not (and does not) happen.  Despite being declared Clear,
				people still had bad memories or lost their temper or had down days and so on.  This was a problem.  The fact that auditing ultimately
				does not work as it purports to do contributed to the need for further 'revelation.'</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This led to the addition of the spiritual aspect which eventually developed into
				Scientology.  The 1951 publication <i>Science of Survival</i> introduced the idea of the <i><b>theta</b></i> (or <i>spirit</i>) having
				an existence separate from the physical universe of matter, energy, space and time (referred to as MEST).  The theta is senior to and
				the source of MEST.  Each individual is referred to as a <i><b>thetan</b></i> (or <i>thought unit</i>).  The thetan is the real person
				which is immortal and can exist independently from the mind and body which it uses to interact and relate to the physical
				universe.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When a person's body dies and the mind ceases to function then the thetan moves on --
				usually to another body.  Thus Hubbard incorporated the eastern concept of reincarnation into his evolving 'theology.' </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Do I detect a certain 'Tone?'</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The degree of compatibility of the theta and MEST as they relate to each other is very
				important.  The better they interact, the better an individual 'survives.'  This compatibility is measured by Scientologists on what they
				call the <i><b>Tone scale</b></i>.  The range goes from <b>0.0</b> (which is 'Body Death') up to <b>40.0</b> ('Serenity of Beingness').
				In between are many categories of a person's 'being' set off with a number and a one or two word description.  These descriptive words
				are typically emotions  (cf. <i>What is Scientology?</i>, pp. 72-73) which Hubbard claims reflect either the ease or the difficulty of
				the interplay between theta and MEST in a given person's life.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The critical level, according to Hubbard seems to be <b>2.0</b> which is labeled
				'Antagonism.'  Anyone at that level or below seems to fit into the category of having a life which is not worthy to be lived.  Consider
				some of the following quotations from <a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/5.htm">http://www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/5.htm</a>:
				<blockquote>
					<i>In any event, any person from 2.0 down on the Tone Scale should not have, in any thinking society, any civil rights of any kind,
					because by abusing those rights he brings into being arduous and strenuous laws which are oppressive to those who need no such
					restraints.</i> - L.  Ron Hubbard, <i>Science of Survival</i>, 1989 Ed., p. 145 [The "Tone Scale" is Scientology's measure of mental
					and spiritual health.]
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>There are only two answers for the handling of people from 2.0 down on the Tone Scale, neither one of which has anything to do with
					reasoning with them or listening to their justification of their acts. The first is to raise them on the Tone Scale by
					un-enturbulating some of their theta by any one of the three valid processes. The other is to dispose of them quietly and without
					sorrow.</i> - L. Ron Hubbard, <i>Science of Survival</i>, p. 170.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>The sudden and abrupt deletion of all individuals occupying the lower bands of the Tone Scale from the social order would result in
					an almost instant rise in the cultural tone and would interrupt the dwindling spiral into which any society may have entered.</i>  -
					L. Ron Hubbard, <i>Science of Survival</i>, p. 170.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>A Venezuelan dictator once decided to stop leprosy. He saw that most lepers in his country were also beggars. By the simple expedient
					of collecting and destroying all the beggars in Venezuela an end was put to leprosy in that country.</i> - L. Ron Hubbard, <i>Science
					of Survival</i>, p. 171.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whether that last reference to an alleged genocide in Venezuela actually happened is
				unknown (given his habit of making things up, it seems doubtful), nevertheless the fact that Hubbard approves it as a positive thing
				reveals his estimation of human life. Once again, Hubbard's impatience and disdain for those he evaluates as not up to par becomes
				obvious.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Going from 'Clear' to 'OT'</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The goal, of course, is to raise your rating on the Tone Scale so that your life
				improves (and so you don't become a target for elimination).  However, as we have seen, the auditing didn't produce to the extent
				promised.  What could be the problem?   Return now to the idea of reincarnation.  The basic levels of auditing only dealt with the
				experiences you've had in <b>this</b> life.  But since you've had many lives and each one had negative experiences, those engrams are
				still affecting your 'thetannessicity' (OK, I admit it -- I made that term up myself. See how easy it is?).  All the negative incidents
				on a person's time track must be addressed.  Once they are, <b>then</b> the individual can expect that he or she will begin to experience
				some of the amazing changes and benefits which auditing is alleged to effect.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Progressing in this way on <i>'The Bridge to Total Freedom'</i> (their term this time)
				is the key to restoring a person to his native state, as it were.  In other words he or she is working toward becoming an <i><b>'operating
				thetan'</b></i> or <b>O.T.</b> for short.  Recalling that a thetan has control over MEST, the ultimate promise is that a person who moves
				toward and reaches the final destination of O.T. 8 then he or she will be able to create and control his or her reality.  These god-like
				abilities are another carrot Scientology holds out to further entice recruits and keep their current crop hooked.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What are some of the things people going for more processing after being declared
				<i>'clear'</i> learn?  In a sidebar of Richard Behar's article '<i>The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power</i>' for the May 6, 1991 edition
				of <i>Time</i>, he supplies some of the following information.  At O.T. 1-2 they are introduced to the fact that, even though they are
				<b>clear</b>, they have still more engrams which have not been dealt with as of yet. They also learn that some of the engrams were
				implanted about 75 million years ago.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At O.T. 3-4 they receive the story of Xenu (also called <i>Incident II</i>), with
				which we introduced this section.  They learn that many of those disembodied spirits, being so numerous, cluster and cling to us because
				there are not enough physical bodies to go around for each of them to have their own.  They learn that these <i><b>'body thetans'</b></i>
				(or <i>B.T.'s</i>) are also a negative influence on our survival and 'beingness.'  (One woman said that after she was introduced to this
				concept, she had to consciously make herself not rub her arms and body in an attempt to wipe away the multitudes of invisible beings
				clinging to her.)    Drug problems in prior lives are also addressed at this level.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At O.T. 5-7 the very important lesson of how to telepathically ask one's body thetans,
				at least those which are conscious enough to respond, to desist and depart is learned.  The person who completes level 7 is said to be
				an 'operating thetan.'
				<blockquote>
					<b>NOTE:</b> One would hope this is done in a respectful and polite manner. After all, these poor spirits were placed on volcanoes,
					nuked and forced to watch bad movies for a long time -- haven't they been through enough?  But maybe not, in Behar's article he
					shares that in his later years, Hubbard could be heard screaming at his body thetans.  Perhaps he was trying to wake up the ones
					which had not regained consciousness yet.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O.T. 8 is only taught at sea on Scientology's yacht, the <i>Freewinds</i>.  The level
				is entitled '<i>The Truth Revealed</i>'.   While information about content is not readily available, some of the rumored subjects
				(cf. <a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/conf_mat.html">http://www.xenu.net/archive/conf_mat.html</a>) may include:
				<ul>
					<li>
						discovering your actual identities in past lives;
					</li>
					<li>
						body thetans in other universes; and
					</li>
					<li>
						investigating the concept of the eighth dynamic of survival (that is, surviving in an infinite way--maybe becoming like God?).
					</li>
				</ul>
				Another rumor, according to Behar, is that the truth they reveal is that Hubbard himself is God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does it work?  After a person spends all that time (and money -- see the next section)
				what does he gain?  Peace of mind? Perfection? God-like abilities?  Let's hear the testimony of someone who knows. The following is taken
				from an open letter by long time Scientologist Michael Pattinson who got there and was disappointed.

					Originally posted: 12 November 2005<br />
					Dear Scientologist,<br />
					<p>
						I completed New OT8 in February 1990 after being in Scientology since 1973. During that period I was mainly "public" but did
						several years as a staff member in Paris Org as Qual Sec. I trained up to be a C/S, FPRD and Confessional auditor and solo
						auditor. I was a Scientology celebrity as an international fine artist, creating beautiful paintings of "visualized" music.
						Many Scientologists (thousands) knew me personally from my art tours of orgs and missions in the early 1980s. ...  I have done
						conditions formulas till they were coming out of my ears, and tons and tons of other ethics, tech and admin applications. I
						personally knew the Flag Class 12 auditors from the Apollo as I trained with them at Flag, I have known the Int Execs since
						they were teenagers, I have personally known all LRH's children. I have known and frequented many of the Scientology celebrities
						too.  I WENT ALL THE WAY UP THE BRIDGE (there is no available level above New OT8).  What happened then is why I am writing this
						letter. I wish it was not necessary to write this but it is. I firmly believe that Truth is a friend to, and that lies are an
						enemy of survival. Yes, feel free to investigate what I write about here ... </p>
					<p>
						It is truly heartbreaking for me to have to inform you that you have been lied to, and not just in a small way. I am so, so
						sorry to have to tell you this, but please bear with me.</p>
					<p>
						You have been lied to regarding the "Bridge to Total Freedom" as it does not arrive at Total Freedom. I know this because I
						have been there and experienced it. OT8 is NOT Total Freedom, yet there is no more Bridge to travel. You may have wondered why
						OTs still behave in "strange" or weird ways and still exhibit aberrated behaviors. They are on the big secret missed withhold
						of not having received what LRH promised. Every non-OT "misses" the withhold.</p>
					<p>
						You have been lied to about OT powers. I will not go into any case data or OT level data as it is not necessary, but I can tell
						you that the advertised and promised OT powers LRH writes about such as telekinesis (moving objects as a thetan), perfect total
						recall, "clear" of any and all aberrations, permanently Cause over Life, real- life Cause over MEST, etc are NOT in reality
						delivered by Scientology (in my direct experience and in that of many others).</p>
					<p>
						You have been lied to about LRH's death, and the lies were criminally false. The "story" about LRH deciding to causatively but
						regrettably depart his body, go off to research further OT levels, etc. was very likely a pack of lies. The coroner's report
						found a psychiatric drug (Vistaril") in LRH's body after death as well as many needle marks. The surrounding circumstances of
						LRH's death such as a very unkempt body, changing his Will a day before he died, the hurried cremation, the refusal of autopsy,
						all make for a very suspicious situation. LRH had been hiding out at the Creston ranch under the false name "Jack Mitchell" so
						as not to be served with lawsuits, as those who knew have revealed.  You have been lied to about LRH's biography, and in many
						aspects of it, not just a few.
					</p>

				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though it is easy to poke a little fun at the gullibility and the strange beliefs of
				these folks, at the end of the day what we must see is that many lives are ruined.  They have responsibility in that, yes, but they only
				want what most people want.  They are just looking in the wrong place for the truth.  Let's try to remember that.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Following the money trail</b> </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last section I suggested that the reason the O.T. levels were developed was
				because Hubbard needed another carrot to keep his Scientologists hooked on and happy with his program.
				<blockquote>
					<b>NOTE:</b> By the way, here is an interesting bit of information about the origin of the O.T. levels:  <i>"I'm drinking lots of
					rum and popping pinks and greys."</i> -- L. Ron Hubbard in a 1967 letter to his wife from the Scientologist cruise ship he was on,
					written during the period when he was creating Scientology's secret "upper levels." (Bent Corydon and L. Ron Hubbard, Jr. a.k.a.
					Ronald DeWolf, <i>L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?</i>, Random House, 1989.) Nothing like a  little help from your
					'friends.'
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why is it so important to keep folks involved in Scientology?  Because it is a huge
				cash cow.  The costs of Scientology processing are astronomical.  The initial 'Personality Test' is free.  The next few steps across
				the <i>Bridge of Enlightenment</i> are the preliminary 'Communications Courses' which cost $250 each.  Next are the Regular Auditing
				and New Era Dianetics levels which are $500 per hour with the time required being indefinite.  It just goes up from there.  In his
				article, <i>The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power</i> for the May 6,1991 edition of <i>Time</i>, Richard Behar estimates that to go
				from beginning to the end (O.T. 8) would cost the average person somewhere between $200,000 to $400,000.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you might imagine, many people's lives were damaged, ruined and even lost because
			of their involvement with this terrible fraud.  Read some examples from Behar's article:
			<blockquote>
				<i>Harriet Baker learned the hard way about Scientology's business of selling religion. When Baker, 73, lost her husband to cancer, a
				Scientologist turned up at her Los Angeles home peddling a $1,300 auditing package to cure her grief. Some $15,000 later, the
				Scientologists discovered that her house was debt free. They arranged a $45,000 mortgage, which they pressured her to tap for more
				auditing until Baker's children helped their mother snap out of her daze. Last June, Baker demanded a $27,000 refund for unused services,
				prompting two cult members to show up at her door unannounced with an E-meter to interrogate her. Baker never got the money and,
				financially strapped, was forced to sell her house in September.</i>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				Dentist Robert Geary of Medina, Ohio, who entered a Sterling [Management Systems] seminar in 1988, endured "the most extreme high-pressure
				sales tactics I have ever faced." Sterling officials told Geary, 45, that their firm was not linked to Scientology, he says.  But Geary
				claims they eventually convinced him that he and his wife Dorothy had personal problems that required auditing.  Over five months, the
				Gearys say, they spent $130,000 for services, plus $50,000 for "gold-embossed, investment grade" books signed by Hubbard. Geary contends
				that Scientologists not only called the bank to increase his credit-card limit but also forged his signature on a $20,000 loan application.
				... At one point, the Gearys claim, Scientologists held Dorothy hostage for two weeks in a mountain cabin, after which she was hospitalized
				for a nervous breakdown.
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				Last October, Sterling broke some bad news to another dentist, Glover Rowe of Gadsden, Ala., and his wife Dee. Tests showed that unless
				they signed up for auditing Glover's practice would fail, and Dee would someday abuse their child. The next month the Rowes flew to
				Glendale, Calif., where they shuttled daily from a local hotel to a Dianetics center. "We thought they were brilliant people because
				they seemed to know so much about us," recalls Dee. "Then we realized our hotel room must have been bugged." After bolting from the
				center, $23,000 poorer, the Rowes say, they were chased repeatedly by Scientologists on foot and in cars.
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				By all appearances, Noah Lottick of Kingston, Pa., had been a normal, happy 24-year-old who was looking for his place in the sun. On the
				day last June when his parents drove to New York City to obtain his body, they were nearly catatonic with grief.  This young
				Russian-studies scholar had jumped from a 10th-floor window of the Milford Plaza Hotel and bounced off the hood of a stretch limousine.
				When the police arrived, his fingers were still clutching $171 in cash, virtually the only money he hadn't turned over to the Church
				of Scientology, the self-help "philosophy" group he had discovered just seven months earlier. Before Noah Lottick killed himself, he had
				paid more than $5,000 for church counseling.
			</blockquote>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Greed from the get-go</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many, many more stories like these. This should not be surprising -- greed was
				the foundation upon which Scientology was built. Hear again from Hubbard's son, L. Ron, Jr. in the 1983 interview with a magazine which
				I don't care to name:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Magazine:</b> <i>Didn't your father have any interest in helping people?</i>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Hubbard:</b>  <i>No.</i>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Magazine:</b>  <i>Never?</i>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Hubbard:</b>  <i>My father started out as a broke science-fiction writer. He was always broke in the late 1940s. He told me and a
						lot of other people that the way to make a million was to start a religion.</i>
						<blockquote>
							<b>NOTE:</b>  Just to further verify this particular allegation:  <i>"I'd like to start a religion. That's where the money
							is."</i> -- L. Ron Hubbard to Lloyd Eshbach, in 1949; quoted by Eshbach in <i>Over My Shoulder: Reflections on a  Science
							Fiction Era</i>, Donald M. Grant Publisher, 1983
						</blockquote>
						<i>Then he wrote the book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health while he was in Bayhead, New Jersey. When we later visited
						Bayhead, in about 1953, we were walking around and reminiscing -- he told me that he had written the book in one month.</i>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Magazine:</b>  <i>There was no church when he wrote the book?</i>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Hubbard:</b>  <i>Oh, no, no. You see, his goal was basically to write the book, take the money and run. But in 1950, this was the
						first major book of do-it-yourself psychotherapy, and it became a runaway best-seller. He kept getting, literally, mail trucks
						full of mail. And so he and some other people, including J. W. Campbell, the editor of Astounding Science Fiction , started the
						Dianetics Research Foundation in Elizabeth, New Jersey. And the post office kept backing up and just dumping mail sacks into the
						building. The foundation had a staff that just ran through the envelopes and threw away anything that didn't have any money in it.</i>
					</li>
				</ul></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, according to Hubbard's son, we see that Dianetics was about making a lot of money
				easily and in a hurry.  This allegation seems to be verified by another source as well:
				<blockquote>
					"<i>Let's sell these people a piece of blue sky</i>."  -- L. Ron Hubbard to an associate in 1950, soon after the opening of the H
					ubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. (Jon Atack, <i>A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed</i>, Lyle
					Stuart/Carol Publishing Group. 1990.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A convenient religious awakening</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, all this activity did not go unnoticed. Soon governmental authorities and
				organizations were beginning to nose around seeing what was going on with Hubbard and his Dianetics.
				<blockquote>
					<i>Almost from the beginning, Hubbard had been in trouble with the law. In 1951 the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners brought
					proceedings against him for teaching medicine without a license; he fled to Los Angeles to escape prosecution. His organizations
					were repeatedly charged with practicing medicine without a license; E-meters and vitamin compounds were seized. The FDA accused
					Scientology of falsely claiming the E-meter could cure medical ailments and all E-meters were required to carry labels disavowing
					such claims.</i>  (From <i>A Brief History of the Church of Scientology</i> found at
					<a href="www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/8.htm">www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/8.htm</a>)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was shortly after this that the Church of Scientology came into existence:
				<blockquote>
					In 1953 Hubbard regained control of Dianetics after a protracted legal battle and incorporated the Church of Scientology, Church of
					American Science and Church of Spiritual Engineering. In 1954 he incorporated the Church of Scientology of California, which became
					the mother church. In 1956 the church was granted US federal tax-exempt status. (Ibid.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In that same 1983 interview, L. Ron Hubbard offers insight on why Hubbard went this
				route:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Magazine:</b>  <i>And what is the Church of Scientology?</i>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Hubbard:</b> <i>It's one of my father's many organizations. It was formed in 1953, basically to avoid the harassment of my
						father by the medical profession and the IRS. The idea of Scientology didn't really exist before that point as a religion,
						but my father hit upon turning it into a church after he started feeling pressured.</i>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, L. Ron Hubbard finally realized the dream of having his own religion and living
				the high life as a result.  And, over the years, from what we've seen, the underlying foundational philosophy seems to have stayed intact,
				as reflected in the following quotation taken once more from
				<a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/5.htm">http://www.xenu.net/archive/infopack/5.htm</a>:
				<blockquote>
					<i>MAKE MONEY. MAKE MORE MONEY. MAKE OTHER PEOPLE PRODUCE SO AS TO MAKE MORE MONEY.</i> -- L. Ron Hubbard, Hubbard Communications
					Office Policy Letter, 9 March 1972, MS OEC 384 (caps his).

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>History:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One cannot even begin to consider the history of Scientology without first taking a look
				at its founder, L. Ron Hubbard.  That the origin and development of Scientology is due to Hubbard's work is without doubt:
				<blockquote>
					<i>L. Ron Hubbard is the Founder of Scientology.  He has described his philosophy in more than 5,000 writings, including dozens of books,
					and in 3,000 tape recorded lectures.</i> (<i>What is Scientology?</i>, Bridge Publications, Inc., 1993, p. 25.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These written and spoken words of Hubbard's are taken by his adherents as the ultimate
				source of authority for Scientologists.  Indeed, as one continues to read various Scientology sources, it becomes abundantly clear that
				Hubbard is immensely admired by his followers.  Words and phrases such as "<i>universal acclaim</i>," "<i>one of the leading lights</i>"
				and "<i>true Renaissance man</i>" are used by them to describe his character, abilities and popularity.  With such a strong connection,
				then, between the founder and the religion, it is reasonable to expect that an examination of the man himself should provide valuable
				insight into the movement he started and promoted.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think the reader will find this relatively brief look at Hubbard to be quite
				interesting.  As we will see, though there may be sharp disagreement between his supporters and his critics about many of the details of
				his life, none will dispute that he was a very colorful character indeed.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>General consensus</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us begin with those facts about Hubbard with which there is little, if any, dispute
				between Scientologists, critics and whatever official documentation is available to be cited.  Lafayette Ronald Hubbard was born
				March 13, 1911 in Tilden, Nebraska to Harry Ross and Ledora May Hubbard.  By the time L. Ron was two years old, the family had moved to
				Kalispell, Montana and soon afterward to Helena.  In 1917, his father, Harry, rejoined the U.S. Navy as an officer.  Public school records
				show that L. Ron was educated in Montana, California, Washington and Virginia.  Apparently the family moved from Montana to California and
				spent some time there before relocating to the Seattle area in 1923.  From 1930-32, he  attended George Washington University.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shortly afterward and for the balance of the 1930's, L. Ron Hubbard began writing for
				"pulp fiction" magazines and was successful, being best known for his science fiction stories.  From 1942-45, he served in the U.S. Navy.
				In 1950, Hubbard published <i>Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</i>.  The book was a national bestseller and L. Ron founded
				the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation to teach and apply the healing techniques described therein.  His second work, <i>Science of
				Survival</i>, was published in 1951.  However, the Foundation did not survive for very long and in its place L. Ron founded Hubbard
				College which, in 1952, was renamed the Hubbard Association of Scientologists International.  In 1954, this organization was absorbed by
				the newly organized Church of Scientology.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He stepped down as the official leader of the church on September 1, 1966.  The church,
				however, had purchased some large, ocean going vessels and from 1967 to 1975, Hubbard lived mostly at sea developing new techniques for
				treatments and organizational principles for church administration.  Upon his return to shore, he shared and implemented these new ideas
				and began writing again -- pamphlets and booklets for Scientology and also science fiction novels.  He settled in California, first near
				Palm Springs until 1979 and then near San Luis Obispo until his death on January 24, 1986.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Remarkable claims</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scientologists, however, claim much more for Hubbard than what has thus far been stated.
				The following informational nuggets come from the previously referenced 1993 edition of their introduction manual and primer <i>What is
				Scientology?</i>  Remarkable as he was, if all we are about to see were also true, L. Ron would certainly have been quite a guy!  Consider
				the following assertions:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Not only could he ride horses at the age of three and a half, but was soon able to rope and break broncos with  the best of them.</i>
					(p. 26)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Under</i> [his mother's] <i>guidance, Ron was reading and writing at an early age, and soon satisfying his insatiable curiosity about life
					with the works of Shakespeare, the Greek philosophers and other classics.</i> (p. 27)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>At the age of six, he became a blood brother of the Blackfeet, an honor bestowed on few white men.</i> (p. 28)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>In early 1923, when Ron was twelve, he and his family moved to Seattle, Washington ... He joined the Boy Scouts and that year
					proudly achieved the rank of Boy Scout First Class.  The  next year he became the youngest Eagle Scout ever, an early indication
					that he did not plan to live an ordinary life.</i>  (p. 29)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>At the end of that year, young Ron traveled to the nation's capital ... meeting Commander Joseph C. Thompson of the US Navy Medical
					Corps ...</i> [who] <i>was the first officer sent ... to study under Sigmund Freud and took it upon himself to pass on the essentials of
					Freudian theory to his young friend.</i>  (p. 29)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>In 1927, at the age of sixteen, Ron took the first of his several voyages across the Pacific to  Asia.  There, both on his own and in
					the company of an officer attached to the British legation, he took advantage of this unique opportunity to study Far Eastern culture.
					Among others he befriended and learned from was a thoroughly insightful Beijing magician who represented the last of the line of
					Chinese magicians from the court of Kublai Khan.</i>  (p. 30)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>It was also through the course of these travels that Ron gained access to the much talked about but rarely seen Buddhist lamaseries in
					the Western Hills of China -- temples usually off limits to both local peasants and visiting foreigners. ... By the age of nineteen,
					long before the advent of commercial airplane or jet transportation, he had traveled more than a quarter  million miles, including
					voyages not only to China but also Japan, Guam, the Philippines and other points in the Orient.</i>  (pp. 31-32)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>He enrolled at George Washington University. ... But fate and his father placed him, fortunately in mathematics and engineering
					instead.  With his knowledge of many cultures and his growing awareness of the human condition, his background in engineering and
					mathematics  would serve him well in undertaking a scientific approach to solving the riddles of existence and man's spiritual
					potential. ... he enrolled in one of the first nuclear physics courses taught in the United States.</i>  (p. 35)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Deciding that formal study had nothing more to offer, L. Ron Hubbard left college in the depths of the Depression, ... He directed
					two expeditions, the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition, a two-and-a-half month, 5000 mile voyage ... and the West Indies
					Mineralogical Expedition, which completed the first mineralogical survey of the island of Puerto Rico under US rule.</i>  (p. 38)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>At the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Hubbard was commissioned as a lieutenant (junior grade) in the US Navy and served as a commander
					of corvettes.  He saw action in both the Atlantic and Pacific, ... In 1945, left partially blind with injured optic nerves and lame
					from hip and back injuries, Mr. Hubbard was hospitalized at Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California.</i>  [After helping
					others with his new techniques] ... <i>he used the same procedures to cure injuries and wounds he himself had received, fully recovering
					his health by 1949.  So complete was his recovery, ... the Navy Retiring Board reviewing Lt. Hubbard's case ... designated him fit
					for active duty.</i>  (pp. 42-44)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are more items and claims about Hubbard which are mentioned in other works or in
				his personal interviews but we will be content to examine these for now.  Just how accurate are these various nuggets of information about
				L. Ron Hubbard, Founder of Scientology?  Let's see.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Did L. Ron lie about his life?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On a webpage entitled "<i>What Scientology Won't Tell You</i>" in an article called
				<i>Who Was L. Ron Hubbard?</i> the author comments that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The church has published many biographical summaries over the years. These have contained a large number of claims that do not
					survive fact checking.</i>  (<i>xenu.net</i> cited February 23, 2011.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we evaluate the information we have seen about Hubbard, obviously, not all the
				assertions can be either verified or refuted by actual records, especially in his very early years.  But this author will contend that,
				in these cases, common sense can be brought to bear to ascertain the likelihood that they actually occurred.  For instance, I could
				certainly see a three and a half year old boy being placed on a  gentle horse and led around by an adult and so, in that way, it can be
				said that he is riding it.  But I seriously doubt that the same boy (or even a four or five year old) is likely to be breaking wild
				horses.  In the same manner, I have heard of precocious children who read the newspaper at four to six years of age but I find it hard
				to credit that even an extremely bright boy of that age would find the works of Shakespeare, Aristotle, Socrates, etc. to be very
				interesting or intelligible.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As far as Hubbard being a blood brother of the Blackfeet it hardly seems likely since
				the reservation was over one hundred miles from his home in Helena.  In his book, <i>A Piece of Blue Sky</i> (p. 48), former
				Scientologist Jon Atack says that at some point in the 1930's, Hubbard admitted that what he knew of the Blackfeet nation came second
				hand from an acquaintance who actually had been a tribal blood brother. (As cited in <i>The Ultimate Spin Doctor: L. Ron Hubbard -- The
				Man and His Myth</i> by Craig Branch, <i>The Watchman Expositor</i>.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Boy Scouts do have a record of Ronald Hubbard becoming an Eagle Scout in 1924 but
				it was in Washington, D.C., not Seattle.  Further, there is no way to verify he was the youngest ever in history since the Boy Scouts
				did not keep records of the ages of Eagle Scouts in those years (Branch, <i>The Ultimate Spin Doctor</i>).  And with regard to learning
				the basics of Freudian psychology at the age of thirteen from one of his father's colleagues in the Navy that, too, seems a little
				farfetched.  Why would the man even bother and why would a teenager even be interested -- and, by the way, wouldn't young Ron's father
				be a little concerned that this colleague of his wanted to spend so much time with his son?  It doesn't add up.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we move on into later years of Hubbard's life, there is more documentation available
				to either substantiate or refute some of these fantastic claims.  For instance, concerning his travel in the Orient during his later
				teenage years, researchers have pieced together a very different account than what Scientology proposes.  Craig Branch, researcher/writer
				for the <i>Watchman Expositor</i>, does a good job of relating the pertinent information in his article, <i>The Ultimate Spin Doctor:
				L. Ron Hubbard--The Man and His Myth:</i>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Fact: L. Ron Hubbard, accompanied by his mother, took a round-trip to Guam in 1927 to visit his father who was stationed there.
					<ul>
						<li>
							The ship spent a brief time in two Chinese ports, visited Hawaii, Yokohama, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. His
							diary entries show that he was unimpressed with the culture and the people, in fact, his comments were full of contempt.
						</li>
						<li>
							He spent six weeks on Guam (A Piece of Blue Sky, pp. 53-4).
						</li>
						<li>
							He was back in Helena, attending high school from September 6, 1927 to May 11, 1928 (Ibid., p. 55). He failed to graduate
							due to lack of credits.
						</li>
						<li>
							In July 1928, Hubbard decided to return to his parents in Guam and it was during this period that he visited China with
							both parents.
							<ul>
								<li>
									The ship docked at Tsingtao, the Hubbards traveled to Peking, Cheffoo, Shanghai, and finally Hong Kong.
								</li>
								<li>
									In Peking, young Ron did visit a Buddhist temple. The trip, in its entirety, lasted two months (Ibid., pp. 55-7).
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						His diary said nothing about studying with wise men of the East, or any other spiritual insights. However, it did describe the
						Lama temples as "very odd and heathenish" (The Los Angeles Times, June 24, 1990, p. A39). The diary reveals Hubbard's
						intolerance for other cultures and/or races in noting that China's problem was that there were too many "Chinks" (Ibid.).
					</ul>
					(watchman.org  cited February 23, 2011.)</i>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Records show that Hubbard did indeed attend George Washington University from 1930-32.
				However his career there was somewhat less than stellar.  In his first year he had a D grade average and was placed on probation.  In his
				second (and final) year he received a D in Calculus and also in Electrical and Magnetic Physics.  He received an F in Molecular and Atomic
				Physics and was placed on academic probation during his second year.  He left school and did not return after that second year. (What
				Scientology Won't Tell You -- An Information Pack <i>"Who Was L. Ron Hubbard?"</i> xenu.net cited Feb. 23, 2011; also Craig Branch,
				<i>"The Ultimate Spin Doctor"</i> watchman.org cited Feb. 23, 2011.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Citing <i>A Piece of Blue Sky</i> (pp. 62-63) by Jon Atack, Branch shares that the
				Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition which Hubbard led actually only made it to three of the sixteen planned stops and that no actual
				film work was accomplished.  In Puerto Rico it was discovered that a man named <i>Bela</i> Hubbard had actually done a mineralogical
				survey in one district in 1923 (back when L. Ron was 12).  No one who had expertise in Puerto Rico's geology had ever heard of L. Ron
				Hubbard.  (Ibid.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With regard to Hubbard's service in the U.S. Navy during World War II let me once again
				directly quote Craig Branch's article <i>The Ultimate Spin Doctor</i> at <a href="http://www.watchman.org">www.watchman.org</a>:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Fact: Through the Freedom of Information Act, The Los Angeles Times received Hubbard's actual military, V.A., and medical records.
					<ul>
						<li>
							The highest rank Hubbard ever received was Lieutenant senior grade, not Commodore [as claimed by Scientology] which is the
							rank between Captain and Rear Admiral.
						</li>
						<li>
							Hubbard's service record shows that he never saw action against the enemy, and received only four awards, none for combat
							or wounds. He was never awarded the Purple Heart (Ibid.; also, military service records on file).
						</li>
						<li>
							Naval records described Hubbard:
							<ul>
								<li>
									"By assuming unauthorized authority and attempting to perform duties for which he has no qualification he became the
									source of much trouble." ...
								</li>
								<li>
									"This officer is not satisfactory for independent duty assignment. He is garrulous and tries to give impressions of
									his importance. He also seems to think that he has unusual ability in most lines. These characteristics indicate
									that he will require close supervision for satisfactory performance of any intelligence duty" (Memo from U.S. Naval
									Attache L.D. Causey to the Commandant, Twelfth Naval District, February 14, 1942).
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							And more than a year later,
							<ul>
								<li>
									"Consider this officer lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation. He acts without
									forethought as to probable results." ...
								</li>
								<li>
									"Not considered qualified for command or promotion at this time. Recommend duty on a large vessel where he can be
									properly supervised" (File # 113392, "Report on the Fitness of Officers," Period from May 29, 1943 to July 7, 1943).
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					After claiming to have destroyed two enemy submarines, an investigation concluded it didn't happen. Later, L. Ron Hubbard, according
					to an investigation, disregarded orders and conducted gunnery practice in Mexican territorial waters. He was relieved of command and
					a letter of admonition was placed in his files. "In Hubbard's defense, Scientology officials accused others of distorting and
					misrepresenting his military glories. They say the Navy 'covered up' Hubbard's sinking of the submarines" (Los Angeles Times,
					June 24, 1990; also, military service records on file).</i>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, it is not just the Navy who disputes Hubbard's claims for his military career.
				The March 1, 1998 issue of <i>The Boston Herald</i> in an article by Joseph Mallia interviewed Eugene LaMere, who served on the same vessel
				as Hubbard. The ship in question, the YP-422, was a refitted "<i>freighter armed only with a 3-inch gun and two .30-caliber machine
				guns</i>".  The article quotes LaMere as saying, "<i>The YP-422 never saw combat</i>."  (www.rickross.com cited February 23,
				2011.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last part of the final item in the list of Hubbard's many accomplishments according
				to <i>What is Scientology?</i> (pp. 42-44) told of L. Ron using his techniques to heal others and himself so that he was completely healthy
				and the Navy Review Board was forced to declare him fit for duty.  Once again Branch comments:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Furthermore, the medical files show that when he was admitted to Oak Knoll he had 20/20 vision, with glasses, and there is no mention of
					"injured optic nerves." At the time he left the hospital his eyesight was 12/20 in the right eye and 14/20 in the left, with glasses.
					This coincided with Hubbard's application for a disability pension. Interestingly, his military records show Hubbard stating he
					"contracted conjunctivitis from exposure to excessive tropical sunlight" (Ibid.).
					<blockquote>
						Fact: In October 1947 Hubbard wrote to the Veteran's Administration asking for psychiatric treatment due to suffering from wartime
						service. By 1948, Hubbard was able to get a disability award of 40% for his "duodenal ulcer, infection of the eyes, bursitis of the
						right shoulder and arthritis of multiple joints."
					</blockquote>
					In an August 1951 medical examination, Hubbard complained of the same conditions listed in his disability award, and according to a letter
					from the Veteran's Administration, he was still receiving the 40% disability compensation in 1973. In fact, he continued to receive his
					40% disability check through at least 1980 (The Los Angeles Times, June 24, 1990, p. A38, and records on file). "Hubbard's Sea Org 'Medical
					Officer,' Kim Douglas, testified in court that while she attended him from 1975 to 1980, he suffered from arthritis, bursitis and coronary
					trouble, which Dianetics was supposed to alleviate."  He wore glasses, in private, the rest of his life (A Piece of Blue Sky, p. 87).</i>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Unfair portrayal by ex-Scientologists?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scientologists respond to these sorts of attacks in a few different ways.  One way,
				which Craig Branch mentioned regarding the submarine 'cover-up', is by asserting that some of Hubbard's experiences and records were
				suppressed or altered so as to put him in a bad light and discredit him.  (Why the U.S. Navy would do that several years before Hubbard
				even dreamed up the concept of Dianetics is another question.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another way they defend themselves is to assert that some foes of Scientology are being
				unfair because they dislike the man personally and have a grudge against him.  They are simply disgruntled and looking for payback.  It is
				true that many of his harshest critics are former members of the Church of Scientology who claim to have had some terrible experiences or
				who were greatly disappointed with what they discovered there. On the other hand, it must also be asked:  <i>Who would be more qualified
				to disclose what is truly happening than those who were on the inside?</i></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One such insider was a man named Gerald Armstrong.  Citing once again Jon Atack's book
				entitled <i>A Piece of Blue Sky</i> (pp. 328-29), Craig Branch shares that Armstrong had been a deeply devoted member of the branch of
				the Church referred to as <i>Sea Org</i>.  This sort of paramilitary, Navy-style arm of Scientology, with uniforms, ribbons, et cetera,
				was conceived by Hubbard during his eight year cruise.  Only the most loyal followers could be part of Sea Org (demonstrated by the fact
				that to join they must sign an agreement obligating them to serve for a <b>billion</b> years).  Armstrong was a trusted aide -- trusted
				so much, in fact, that he was chosen for the prestigious position of "<i>Personal Public Relations Research Officer</i>".  This was, in
				essence, the title for the coordinator of the effort to put together the official biography concerning the life of one L. Ron
				Hubbard.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the course of his duties, Armstrong began gathering all the information on Hubbard
				possible.  Some documents were, of course, a matter of public record, but Armstrong was given access to all the pertinent personal
				documents available as well.  These included letters, diaries, medical records and so on.  When Armstrong began to realize that the p
				ublic image which Hubbard and the Church of Scientology were promoting did not match up very well with the information in the documents
				he was studying, he decided to leave the Church.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Knowing that the church might not simply let him leave without harassment (or worse),
				Armstrong made copies or kept many of the documents for his own protection.  In 1984 the Church of Scientology did indeed bring legal
				action against Armstrong charging him with stealing their private papers.  In the course of the case [<i>Church of Scientology v.
				Armstrong, No. C420153 California Supreme Court, 1984</i>], the facts about the truth of Hubbard's life came to light.  Once again let
				me refer to Craig Branch's article:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Armstrong  demonstrated, through the documents, that contrary to Hubbard's claims, he was not educated in higher mathematics or
					physics, did not obtain a bachelor of science degree, was not a civil engineer, nor a nuclear physicist, was not in China at age
					14, and lied about the time he did spend traveling in Asia, did not study with Lama priests, was never in India, was not crippled
					and blinded during the war, was not twice pronounced dead, did not cure himself with his discoveries, was not awarded 21 medals and
					palms, did not see combat, and that Hubbard had lied about many other things to embellish his image.</i> (<i>L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah
					or Madman?</i> by Croydon and Hubbard, Jr., pp. 220-2 cited in <i>The Ultimate Spin Doctor</i>
					<a href="http://www.watchman.org">www.watchman.org</a>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The judge, Paul Breckenridge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, ruled in Gerald
				Armstrong's favor and issued a scathing statement based on the evidence:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The organization clearly is schizophrenic and paranoid, and this bizarre combination seems to be a reflection of its founder, LRH.
					The evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history, background and achievements.</i>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no doubt that anytime a movement or organization is criticized, the tendency
				is to point out the motives and/or the agenda of the critic.  In this case those who are yet members of Scientology dismiss critics as
				being disenchanted or disappointed about their experiences and they question who was truly at fault -- the Church itself or the bitter
				person?  In some cases, there may be some validity to those kinds of responses from the ones being criticized.  Certainly it is reasonable
				to examine the motives and agenda of someone when they launch an assault against another.  However, that reasoning does not completely
				explain the discrepancies between what Hubbard claimed for his life and the cold, hard facts of what actually happened.  It would be h
				ard for me to put my faith in a system developed by a man proven in a court of law to be a "<i>pathological liar</i>".</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Intimidation tactics</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gerald Armstrong had good reason to stash documents and information about Hubbard
				and Scientology -- he knew the organization's methodology.  They do not easily let people leave their ranks and they do not allow foes
				to criticize them with no consequences.  Scientologists respond to attacks by critics by counterattacking with the intention of ruining
				the lives of their enemies.  A certain magazine (whose label I do not care to share) interviewed Hubbard's son, L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.
				which was published in June, 1983.  In response to a question about the relative scarcity of news and investigative reporting about
				Scientology, Hubbard, Jr. replied:
				<blockquote>
					<i>It's very simple.  Scientology has always had a "fair-game doctrine" -- a policy of doing absolutely anything to stop an
					investigation or publication of a critical article in a magazine or newspaper. They have run some incredible operations on the
					several people who have tried to write books about Scientology. It was almost like a terror campaign. First they'd try throwing
					every possible lawsuit at the reporter or newspaper. We had a team of attorneys to do just that. The goal was to destroy the enemy.
					So the solution was always to attack, full-bore, with every possible resource, from every angle, instantaneously it can certainly
					be overwhelming. A guy would get slapped with twenty-seven lawsuits, and our lawyers would start depositioning absolutely anybody
					who ever knew the man, digging up dirt while at the same time putting together an operation that would get him into further trouble.
					I know of one case, concerning Paulette Cooper, who wrote a book called The Scandal of Scientology, in which they spent almost
					$500,000 trying to destroy her.  ...
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					My father drilled into all of us: Don't go to court thinking to win a lawsuit. You go to court to harass, to delay, to exhaust the
					enemy financially, physically, mentally. You file every motion you can think of and you just lock them up in court. The courts, for
					my father, were never used to seek justice or redress, but to destroy the people  he thought were enemies, to prevent negative
					stories from appearing.  ...
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					You must realize that there is very little actual courage in this world. It's pretty easy to bend people around. It doesn't take
					much to shut people up, it really doesn't. In the fifties all I had to do was call a guy up on the telephone and say, "Well, I
					think your wife would like to know about your mistress." The response would be a shocked [exclamation].  I'd say, "Well, nobody
					really wants to divulge that kind of information. I think it would be absolutely terrible if your wife found out, so I'm going to
					make absolutely sure that she doesn't find out. Now, if you just drop in here for a little more auditing ... Now you know in your
					heart that the critical things you've been saying about Scientology are just vindictive. They're not really true in your heart.
					You know that, don't you?" And the guy says. "Yeah, sure, I sure do know that!"

					And then, if Scientologists couldn't blackmail you, they'd create some dirt on you through their "special operations." There were
					quite a few of those operations. This one, for example, happened recently. I wasn't involved in it, but Scientologists tried to get
					an assistant attorney general of the state of California embroiled in a fake operation where a Scientologist pretended to be a nun
					and pretended to get pregnant by him and filed papers against him. Then in another scheme they tried to set up the mayor of
					Clearwater, Florida, for a fake hit-and-run accident.  I could give you operation after operation that they set up like this."  ...

				<blockquote>
					You see, these people didn't realize where their information was going. They always thought that in Scientology auditing they had

					Whoever was perceived as his enemy had to be destroyed, including me. This "fair game" policy since the beginning. The organization

				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Well, he didn't really want people killed, because how could you really destroy them if you just killed them? What he wanted to do
					was to destroy their lives, their families, their reputations, their jobs, their money, everything. My father was the type of person
					who, when it came to destruction, wanted to keep you alive for as long as possible, to torture you, punish you. If he chose to
					destroy you, he would love to see you lying in the gutter, strung out on booze and drugs, rolling in your own vomit, with your wife
					and children gone forever: no job, no money. He'd enjoy walking by and kicking you and saying to other people, "Look what I did to
					this man!" He's the kind of man who would pull the wings off flies and watch them stumble around. You see, this fits in with his
					Scientology beliefs, also. He felt that if you just died, your spirit would go out and get another body to live in. By destroying
					an enemy that way, you'd be doing him a favor. You were letting him out from under the thumb of L. Ron. Hubbard, you see?</i>

				Scientology, Hubbard, Jr. said:
				<blockquote>
					<i>There was no way. There were thousands of people, back in the fifties who would come in and receive various levels of training,
					such as a Hubbard Certified Auditor's Certificate or a Bachelor of Scientology or a Doctorate of Scientology, and if they didn't
					toe the mark as my father wanted them to, then we would cancel their certificates. And then he would notify the Scientologists in
					the area where the man lived not to have anything to do with him, to disconnect from him. And if information was available about
					him, we would spread that information around to his wife, his family, his children, where he worked, everywhere. It was straight
					blackmail. It was "Stay in the fold or else." Then, later on, they developed what they called an ethics review board. If you didn't
					toe the mark, you'd be put on trial in front of a kangaroo court and then be sentenced to maybe scrub floors. I heard that you had
					to walk around with a dirty rag tied around your arm like a badge. You could be made to do anything. You would be locked in a
					chain locker or handcuffed to a bed. This is in later years. We were simpler in the fifties, more direct. I just went out and beat
					them up. ...
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Yeah. We'd strongarm them. I did it myself. And you had to realize that I weighed around 240 pounds in those days. When I taught
					Scientology, no students ever blew my courses! I would go out and physically retrieve my students. You know, the Scientologists
					are now trying to make me out to be the worst person since Attila the Hun. They forget that when I was director of training for
					the organization, I trained literally thousands of people. I created a lot of the Scientology processes and procedures throughout
					the fifties. I really helped create and run the organization. I was very deeply involved, very directly, for seven years, during its
					formulation and building. So I find their attempts to discredit me amusing. I used to have a thing about saying that nobody ever
					ran out of my courses. If you think est is tough, you ought to have taken courses under me in the fifties!  ...

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the May 6, 1991 edition of <i>Time</i> magazine, an article by Richard Behar entitled
				<i>The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power</i> (pp. 50-57) was published and concurs with L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.'s testimony:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Scientology devotes vast resources to squelching its critics. Since 1986 Hubbard and his church have been the subject of four
					unfriendly books, all released by small yet courageous publishers. In each case, the writers have been badgered and heavily sued.
					One of Hubbard's policies was that all perceived enemies are "fair game" and subject to being "tricked, sued or lied to or
					destroyed". Those who criticize the church journalists, doctors, lawyers and even judges often find themselves engulfed in
					litigation, stalked by private eyes, framed for fictional crimes, beaten up or threatened with death. Psychologist Margaret Singer,
					69, an outspoken Scientology critic and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, now travels regularly under an assumed
					name to avoid harassment.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					After the Los Angeles Times published a negative series on the church last summer, Scientologists spent an estimated $1 million to
					plaster the reporters' names on hundreds of billboards and bus placards across the city. Above their names were quotations taken out
					of context to portray the church in a positive light.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					The church's most fearsome advocates are its lawyers. Hubbard warned his followers in writing to "beware of attorneys who tell you not
					to sue ... the purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than to win." Result: Scientology has brought hundreds of suits
					against its perceived enemies and today pays an estimated $20 million annually to more than 100 lawyers.   One legal goal of
					Scientology is to bankrupt the opposition or bury it under paper. The church has 71 active lawsuits against the IRS alone. One of
					them, Miscavige vs. IRS, has required the U.S. to produce an index of 52,000 pages of documents.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Boston attorney Michael Flynn, who helped Scientology victims from 1979 to 1987, personally endured 14 frivolous lawsuits, all of
					them dismissed. Another lawyer, Joseph Yanny, believes the church "has so subverted justice and the judicial system that it should
					be barred from seeking equity in any court." He should know: Yanny represented the cult until 1987, when, he says, he was asked to
					help church officials steal medical records to blackmail an opposing attorney (who was allegedly beaten up instead). Since Yanny
					quit representing the church, he has been the target of death threats, burglaries, lawsuits and other harassment.  ...
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Sometimes even the church's biggest zealots can use a little protection. Screen star Travolta, 37, has long served as an unofficial
					Scientology spokesman, even though he told a magazine in 1983 that he was opposed to the church's management. High-level defectors
					claim that Travolta has long feared that if he defected, details of his sexual life would be made public. "He felt pretty intimidated
					about this getting out and told me so," recalls William Franks, the church's former chairman of the board. "There were no outright
					threats made, but it was implicit. If you leave, they immediately start digging up everything." Franks was driven out in 1981 after
					attempting to reform the church.

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These kinds of hardball methods seem outrageous and bizarre to those outside Scientology.
				However, it seems such actions are the norm (or at least not uncommon) for those inside the organization.  The following accounts come
				chiefly from Craig Branch's comprehensive series of articles found at
				<a href="http://www.watchman.org">www.watchman.org</a> (cited May 4, 2011)
				<i><blockquote>
					Two recent and protracted cases clearly demonstrate how Scientology assiduously carries out the policies initiated by L. Ron Hubbard
					for intimidating and harassing its "enemies". Scientology's target in the first case was a former Scientologist, Larry Wollersheim.
					In 1986, Wollersheim won a $30 million jury verdict in compensatory and punitive damages against the Church of Scientology California
					mother church in a case that began in 1980. This was later reduced on appeal to $2.5 million. The courts found that Scientology was
					guilty of intentional and negligent infliction of severe emotional harm. They wrote "Any one of these acts [against Wollersheim]
					exceeds the 'bounds usually tolerated by a decent society' so as to constitute outrageous conduct ... the Church's actions
					unquestionably constituted reckless disregard for the likelihood of causing emotional distress. The policy of fair game, by its
					nature, was intended to punish the person who dared to leave the Church. Here, the church actively encouraged its members to destroy
					Wollersheim's business. Further, by physically restraining Wollersheim from leaving the Church's ship, and subjecting him to further
					auditing despite his protests, the Church ignored Wollersheim's emotional state and callously compelled him to continue in a practice k
					nown to cause him emotional distress (Daily Appellate Report, July 1, 1989, p. 9270).  ...
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Scientology's target in the second case was David Mayo, also a former Scientologist. Mayo won big in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
					Appeals. Mayo was suing Scientology and in typical fashion, Scientology sued him back. The court dismissed Scientology's suit and
					awarded Mayo $2.9 million in attorney's fees. The court applied the tough sanctions against Scientology saying the Church had been
					playing "fast and loose with the legal system" by filing countless frivolous motions, employing "evasions, misrepresentations, broken
					promises and lies, destruction and concealment of documents (Los Angeles Daily Journal, April 18, 1996, p. 3)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					One of the more egregious clandestine attacks uncovered in evidence obtained in the raid was carried out against Paulette Cooper,
					author of the 1972 book, The Scandal of Scientology. Following Hubbard's directive of, "If possible, of course, ruin him utterly,"
					Scientologists smeared Cooper's reputation, then framed her for a felony. Using stationary she had touched, which therefore
					contained her fingerprints, they forged a bomb threat against the Church. Upon discovering the plot, called "Operation Freakout,"
					the prosecutors dropped all charges against Cooper. Besides the emotional anguish and disruption of her life, Scientology's
					outrageous, fraudulent persecution of her cost Cooper $26,000 in legal and psychiatric fees. (Los Angeles Times, June 24, 1990,
					A39). ...
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Another such "attack and destroy" campaign uncovered by the FBI raid was carried out against the then mayor of Clearwater, Florida,
					Gabe Cazares. Documents revealed that "Scientology agents staged a fake hit-and-run accident" against Cazares (Washington Post,
					April 28, 1978, p. A-1).  Furthermore, Scientology attorney Merrell Vanier persuaded Cazares to use his services in a lawsuit
					against Scientology. From this undercover position Vanier was able to provide inside information to Scientology, as well as gain
					access to sensitive files in the State Attorney General's office "which was conducting an investigation of the local Scientology
					organization." After the facts became known Vanier was disbarred by the Florida Supreme Court (Tampa Tribune, November 27, 1986,
					p. 15-B; Opinion, 498 So. 2d 896; 11 Fla. Law W. 621 [Fla. 1986]).
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					One tactic most often used against those who dare to expose abuse in Scientology is a pattern of slanderous information distribution
					in the critic's neighborhood or workplace. (The Sunday Times [London], April 3, 1994). Recently, when participants in a peaceful
					demonstration over Lisa McPherson's death at Scientology headquarters in Clearwater arrived home they discovered fliers distributed
					around their neighborhoods accusing the Scientology critics as religious bigots, a threat to families or worse (Philadelphia Inquirer,
					December 13, 1997; The Event (Salt Lake City), December 18, 1997).  ...
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					But some of the most chilling are the stories of personal abuse ncluding people being held against their will unless they complied
					with more Scientology processing, or being told that they would commit suicide or harm their children if they didn't take more
					expensive Scientology courses etc. (Gadsden Times, May 4, 1991, pp. A1, A6; Cherokee County Herald, December 12, 1990; personal
					testimonies on file).
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Respected British biographer, Russell Miller, wrote a quite revealing book, Bare Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard.
					Following Hubbard's attack policies, Scientology not only sued him in Britain and the United States but hired their chief "private
					investigator," Eugene Ingram, to discredit him. Miller soon found himself being questioned by the police as a suspect for a murder
					because of "an anonymous tip-off from someone who used an extensive knowledge of Miller's work and private life to try to frame
					him" (Sunday Times, October 25, 1987, p. 3.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Scientology has a history of using private investigators to pursue and harass critics. Eugene Ingram, fired from the Los Angeles
					Police Department in 1981, is one of the most notorious. Warrants for Ingram's arrest are still outstanding in Florida and Oklahoma,
					for impersonating a police officer, and for carrying a concealed weapon (copies of warrants on file at WFI).  ...

				<blockquote>
					Many out-of-court settlements have been paid to plaintiffs and defendants in cases involving Scientology. In most of the settlements
					the parties are barred from disclosing the amount. It has been revealed, however, that Julie Titchbourne received $100,000, Gerald
					Armstrong received $800,000. Court documents in a U.S. district court also revealed that Scientology had been willing to pay
					$650,000 to four of at least 10 plaintiffs who all later settled for an undisclosed amount.  ...
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					The church also "settled four multi-million dollar suits" as well as with 11 other plaintiffs and "others with claims against the
					church" for $2.8 million in 1986 (William Horne, "The Two Faces of Scientology," American Lawyer, July, 1992, p. 5, Cult Awareness
					Network News, March, 1987, p. 4).
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Watchman has on file many published accounts of intense harassment and abuse of former members, media reporters, television companies,
					newspapers and magazines, lawyers, and even trial judges who had anything to do with either criticizing or bringing Scientology to
					justice. Two American Lawyer articles detail the extraordinary and chilling accounts of consistent harassment and acts of
					intimidating experienced by various judges assigned to significant lawsuits against Scientology ("Scientology's War Against Judges,"
					December, 1980; "Two Faces of Scientology," July/August, 1992)."
				</blockquote></i>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obviously, these repeated episodes throughout the relatively short history of the
				Church of scientology demonstrate the oppressive character of the organization.   People writing about the Church use terms like
				"<i>terror</i>", "<i>abuse</i>", "<i>tyranny</i>" and "<i>religious mafia</i>" in describing it.  If those terms seem too strong
				consider that some have lost their homes and even their lives primarily because of their involvement with Scientology.
				<blockquote>
					<b>NOTE:</b>  Two of the more well-known examples are:  Noah Lottick, 24, who "jumped to his death from the 10th floor of a Manhattan
					building," after paying Scientology $3,000, and earlier, most of his savings, for their courses (The Times Leader, May 2, 1991, pp.
					1, 12A); and the aforementioned Lisa Mcpherson, 36, who was last in the "care" of Scientology officials at their Ft. Harrison Hotel
					headquarters in Clearwater, FL before being pronounced dead on arrival at a Florida hospital on December 5, 1995.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And finally consider the following testimony of a former Scientologist:
				<blockquote>
					According to the Toronto Sun report on the case, Marion Envoy, former Canadian head of Scientology's Guardian Office, was asked
					'how she reconciled her criminal activities with some of Scientology's statements of principles regarding honesty and freedom.'
					She replied, 'It was the way I was trained ... whatever was necessary to protect ... Hubbard and Scientology.' Criminal acts of
					that kind were 'not considered against any code or moral in Scientology because you were protecting Scientology.' (May 15, 1992).
					As is so often the case in Scientology, the end (i.e. Scientology's vindication and success) justified the means."

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What Hubbard himself wrote about intimidating foes</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far, with regard to the above allegations about Scientology's aggressive attitude
				toward its enemies, we have heard only from those sorts of people which faithful adherents of Scientology would simply dismiss.  In
				other words, they would claim that people like Gerald Armstrong, L. Ron Hubbard, Jr. and William Franks are disillusioned and
				disgruntled former members with axes to grind.  Others, like author Paulette Cooper, Judge Paul Breckenridge and psychologist Margaret
				Singer, are haters who do not understand Scientology and never will.  As we noted earlier there is a certain amount of plausibility
				with that sort of defense.  Nobody wants to be judged or condemned solely on the voices of the opposition. Everyone wants to be given a
				chance to give their side of the story.  And so it is that we should allow L. Ron Hubbard to speak for himself as well.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To my knowledge, there are no claims by Scientology that these quotations of Hubbard
				are incorrect or taken out of context.  This is because the actual bulletins  and documents have been leaked over the years by some of
				the 'disgruntled former members,' thus, there is no way to deny them.  Their methods are and have always been to find some other means
				of leverage to use against their opponents so as to silence them.  They do not bother to try to prove their enemies wrong for, it seems,
				they cannot.  Is this the mark of a good organization to join?  I think not.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Occultic connections</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is one last area that we should explore about L. Ron Hubbard before we leave him.
				He was heavily involved with the occult for several years and it seems that his fascination with it influenced him for the rest of his
				life. As we will see, in some ways Scientology's philosophies are very compatible with those of Satanism and black magic.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to his son, L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.,  when the elder Hubbard was in his mid-teens
				and living in Washington, D.C. with his parents, his mother took him to the Library of Congress where he obtained a copy of <i>The Book of
				the Law</i> by Aleister Crowley in which is a manifesto for humanistic philosophy.  One of the notable and defining statements of the book
				is: "<i>Do what thy wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</i>"  Crowley was a renowned Satanist who referred to himself as "the Beast".
				The information and worldview fascinated Hubbard and would come out later in his own writings and in the evolution of Scientology (e.g.,
				in a taped lecture from 1952 Hubbard states, "<i>Our whole activity tends to make an individual completely independent of any
				limitation</i> ...").  (Corydon and Hubbard, Jr., <i>L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?</i>, 1987)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But his real involvement did not occur until several years later when, just after the
				war and his service in the Navy, Hubbard meets and becomes friends with John (Jack) Parsons.  Most of the following detail comes from
				Russell Miller's book <i>Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard</i>.  Parsons was a brilliant young rocket scientist
				working at the California Institute of Technology who had inherited and lived in a large house in Pasadena, California.  He was well-known
				and respected in his field but he led a double life.  He and his first wife were members of the occultic society <i>Ordo Templi Orientis</i>
				(O.T.O.) founded (coincidentally) by Crowley to foster the growth and practice of sensual black magic.  As a matter of fact Parsons
				corresponded with Crowley regularly for the purpose of extending his admiration for the man and seeking his counsel.  Parsons turned his
				house into a boarding house of sorts which was only open to those who would appreciate a less traditional style of life.  People of that
				stripe came and went freely, some more or less made it their home.  All the while, various occultic rituals and activities were common.
				Eventually, Parsons' wife ran off with one of the other members of the O.T.O. and he turned his attention to her sister who soon moved
				into the house.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parsons also had a love for science fiction and attended the local meetings of some of
				their societies and so came to meet many in that field.  So it was that, in December, 1945, an artist who did illustrations for such
				magazines showed up at Parson's house with L. Ron Hubbard tagging along.  Parsons and Hubbard immediately hit it off and became close
				friends.  Parsons even risked sharing the secrets of the O.T.O. in order to enlist Hubbard as his '<i>magical partner</i>'.  The following
				comes from a letter Parsons wrote to Crowley about Hubbard:
				<blockquote>
					<i>About three months ago I met Captain L. Ron Hubbard, a writer and explorer of whom I had known for some time ... He is a gentleman; he
					has red hair, green eyes, is honest and intelligent, and we have become great friends. He moved in with me about two months ago, and
					although Betty and I are still friendly, she has transferred her affection to Ron</i>.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Although he has no formal training in Magick, he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some
					of his experiences I deduced that he is in direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel. He describes his
					Angel as a beautiful winged woman with red hair whom he calls the Empress and who has guided him through his life and saved him many
					times. He is the most Thelemic</i> [ed. self-willed] <i>person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles ... I
					think I have made a great gain and as Betty and I are the best of friends, there is little loss. I cared for her rather deeply but
					I have no desire to control her emotions, and I can, I hope, control my own. I need a magical partner. I have many experiments in
					mind ...</i>  (Miller, <i>Bare-Faced Messiah</i>, p. 118.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most outrageous '<i>experiment</i>' they tried was to try to produce a '<i>Moon
				Child</i>' (essentially a child of Satan) by enlisting the aid of a willing woman and employing black magic practices before, during and
				after the activity.  The partnership eventually failed. Hubbard ran off with Parsons' girlfriend (the ex-wife's sister) and about $10,000
				of his money.  Parsons had to pursue them to Florida to recover part of his money.  Eventually Parsons married the woman with whom he
				tried to create the Moon Child and sold the large house.  But it was not long before he was killed by an explosion caused by the
				mishandling of nitroglycerin in his home laboratory.  Some have questioned whether it was an accident or suicide.  In the meantime
				Hubbard married the girl, Sara Northrup, he ran off with but did so before divorcing his first wife, Polly.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, when this information came to light, it did not reflect well on Scientology.
				In December, 1969, the Church of Scientology released the following:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Hubbard broke up black magic in America ... because he was well known as a writer and philosopher and had friends among the physicists,
					he was sent in to handle the situation [of black magic being practised in a house in Pasadena occupied by nuclear physicists]. He went
					to live at the house and investigated the black magic rites and the general situation and found them very bad ... Hubbard's mission was
					successful far beyond anyone's expectations. The house was torn down. Hubbard rescued a girl they were using. The black magic group
					was dispersed and never recovered.</i>
				</blockquote>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Current leadership</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">L. Ron Hubbard ostensibly stepped down from 'official' leadership of the Church of
				Scientology in 1966 before going on his eight-year cruise around the world.  Of course, there is little doubt he was still in charge
				and called the shots.  After his return to land (southern California to be precise) in 1975 and even though he spent the last five
				years of his life in self-imposed seclusion (most believe he did this because his health was so bad it was a visible testimony to the
				ineffectiveness of Scientology and the Dianetic process) he still controlled the organization.  So when he died in early 1986 it left
				a huge void in the Scientology leadership hierarchy.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Into this gap stepped twenty-six year old David Miscavige.  He was a high school
				drop-out and second generation Scientologist who at sixteen became intensely involved in the organization. He worked his way up the
				leadership ladder and eventually worked closely with Hubbard and was placed over most of the day-to- day operations.  In 1986 he was
				named Chairman of the Board and continues in that capacity today.  We do not need to spend much time examining his leadership in detail
				because Miscavige's leadership style is mostly more of the same brutish,  heavy-handed techniques he learned from his mentor, L. Ron
				Hubbard.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is worth noting, however, that although probably a majority in the organization
				continue to be intimidated and silent, there are some brave souls coming forward to tell their stories.  This has resulted in many
				testimonies to the abuse within Scientology and of DM himself (as he likes to be called by his subordinates--or 'COB' or simply 'Sir').
				There are multiple allegations of Miscavige personally verbally and physically assaulting those who displease him.  This includes
				profanity-laced tirades, pushing, slapping, punching, slamming into walls or furniture, shoving to the ground and worse.  The attacks
				were to the head and face, to the torso, against men and women alike.  People are routinely injured and degraded.  It is truly hard to
				believe such activity can really happen in this day and time in the United States. (For details of such incidents

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One highlight of his tenure we should mention is the restoration of tax-exempt
				religious status which had been stripped from the 'Church' in 1967.  After Scientology sued the IRS (of course) to regain the exemption,
				the courts ruled in favor of the IRS position in a 1984 U.S. tax court decision and this was later upheld at the U.S. Appeals Court level.
				The U.S. Supreme Court, after ruling in the IRS's favor in a related case (they disallowed the deducting of the cost of auditing),
				refused to hear the appealed case in 1992, effectively ending Scientology's recourse.  It was curious, then, that in 1993 the IRS
				reversed itself and restored Scientology's tax-exempt status.  Curious because it apparently came about as a result of an unscheduled
				meeting between Miscavige and the IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg.  Also curious because Goldberg's decision to appoint a committee to
				negotiate a settlement between the IRS and Scientology bypassed the agency's normal avenues of handling such matters regarding exempt
				organizations.  Not only that but the negotiations and the record of agreements was sealed when other similar cases are open to public
				examination.  Oh, and by coincidence I'm sure, over a hundred lawsuits which had been filed against the IRS by 'individuals' were all
				dropped immediately after the agreement with Scientology was reached.  And by the way, it is also known that private investigators had
				been retained by Scientology's lawyers to dig into the private lives of IRS officials.  Wonder what they found?  (The above information
				comes from: Craig Branch, <i>Scientology: A History of Terror and Abuse</i>, Watchman Expositor, vol. 14, No. 5, 1997 found at
				<a href="http://www.watchman.org">www.watchman.org</a>.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, as we can see, it seems to be mob-like business as usual under Miscavige's
				management of the Church of Scientology.  Now it is finally time to turn our attention to the theory behind the need for Dianetics and
				Scientology and also the  religious activities of the organization.</font></p>

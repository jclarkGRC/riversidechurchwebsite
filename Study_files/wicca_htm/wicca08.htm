			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While I believe that always trying to adopt a particular "method" in witnessing may
				sometimes be counterproductive in that it can become merely a mechanical exercise, I do believe that it is useful to understand that
				particular approaches work better with particular groups of people.  To that end I want to share what I consider to be some of the best
				information I could glean from a couple of sources.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, from the book <i>Generation Hex</i> (pp. 142-144) by Dillon Burroughs and Marla
				Alupoaicei, comes a list of tips cited from a Wiccan practitioner called Gwydion Oak.  In his article, <i>How to Share the Gospel with
				Pagans</i>, Oak gives some good and practical insight:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<i>Do not attack Wiccans.</i>  People who feel like they are being put on the defensive close their ears and minds very quickly.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Get your facts straight.</i>  If you are going to discuss specific fallacies of Wiccan beliefs make sure you get them right. This
						study is an attempt to be as accurate as possible but I do not represent it to be completely comprehensive. And you mustn’t
						assume the person in front of you personally subscribes to anything or everything you’ve seen and heard. <b>Ask questions.</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Be honest about past mistakes made in name of Christianity.</i>  For example, it is not usually helpful to defend the Crusades of
						the Middle Ages to a Muslim nor the Salem witch trials in which many innocent people were condemned and put to death to a Wiccan.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Treat pagans as people first.</i> Oak cites his own experience as feeling like a ‘target of conversion’ for his Christian ‘friends’
						and, when he did not readily convert, how they quickly abandoned and even became hostile to him. That isn’t love, that is having
						an agenda.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Accept that you will not reach every pagan.</i>  Christians must realize that it is not our responsibility to see first-hand every
						Wiccan (or any particular sort of person, for that matter) converted.  Rather it is our responsibility to be faithful to share
						the truth of the gospel with a loving and gracious heart (<b>Colossians 4:5-6</b>).  We are to plant and water and God will
						bring forth the increase in His time (<b>I Corinthians 3:6</b>).
					</li>
				</ol>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, found on the website
				<a href="http://www.arcapologetics.org/comparative-religion/wicca-the-new-old-religion/">www.arcapologetics.org</a>
				in an article entitled <i>Wicca: The New, Old Religion</i> by Keith Gibson are some more good tips:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Make sure that the Wiccan understands what true Christianity really teaches. Many people are not rejecting Christianity per se
						but rather a negative experience within the church. Additionally, there is a great deal of misinformation within Wiccan
						literature concerning Christianity. Because many Wiccan books attack the integrity and preservation of the Scriptures, a basic
						apologetic for the Bible is very helpful.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use your personal testimony. Because Wicca is an experiential religion, one’s personal testimony is particularly meaningful to
						those in the Craft.
					</li>
					<li>
						Deal with the concept that there are no absolutes. Relativism is a position that is simply impossible to hold consistently.
						After all, is the Wiccan Rede absolute or is it just their truth? What if my truth is to burn witches? Am I wrong absolutely
						or is that just the Wiccan’s truth? What about the rule of three and the laws of karma? Are these absolute? The fact is that
						everyone is an absolutist in their heart of hearts. Witches know that some things, such as the Inquisition, are wrong absolutely.
					</li>
					<li>
						Discuss the cruelty of the Wiccan view of evil and karma. If the particular Wiccan to whom you are speaking denies the existence
						of anything actually evil (and they should in order to be consistent with the worldview), ask them why Wiccans universally condemn
						the Inquisition (frequently Wiccans refer to this as the "burning times"). After all, according to Buckland it was necessary that
						those souls gain that experience. In fact, carried to its logical conclusion, there is absolutely no reason (other than a selfish
						one) to help another person who is the victim of misfortune, crime or injustice. One might actually find oneself interfering with
						the erasure of the individual’s karmic debt or the evolution of his/her soul. Additionally, consider that this view mandates that
						everything that happens to each individual is the individual’s own fault. In some way, the person either deserved the action or
						needed it for the soul’s progress. Apply this to an infant who is abused or molested and the ghastliness of this belief becomes
						apparent.
					</li>
					<li>
						Demonstrate the fallen nature of man. G.K. Chesterton said that the doctrine of sin is the one religious doctrine that can be seen
						every day. Why is it that children do not have to be taught to disobey? Deal with personal sin. The Wiccan Rede is perhaps one of
						the most pliable ethics in the entire religious world. Yet despite its relatively low standard, no one is able to keep the Rede
						perfectly. We all harm others. We all say things and do things that cause pain in other people. How does the Wiccan deal with
						personal sin? Reincarnation and karma only increase the individual’s sin debt with each passing lifetime. The burden becomes heavy
						indeed.
					</li>
				</ol>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first set of tips from Burroughs and Alupoaicei is more general in nature and could
				apply to many witnessing situations.  They address our honesty and demeanor toward those to whom we witness for Christ.  The second from
				Gibson is directed more at specific Wiccan teachings and are intended to stimulate the thinking of someone enmeshed in the Craft.  Wiccans
				(as everyone) need to become aware of their own guilt before the Lord God. In other words, they need to recognize their own ‘lostness’ so
				that they can then understand the concept of salvation and desire it.  Both of these sets of tips are needed so that our attitude is right
				and our approach is most effective.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, the most important thing we can do for that Wiccan (or anyone) who we have a
				special burden for is to pray.  The Holy Spirit must be active in convicting and drawing that person to Jesus.  Pray that God will use
				what we say and the testimony of our consistent Christian lives to speak to those around us who do not yet know Jesus as their Lord and
				Savior.  It is my hope that this study will help us to be more effective at reaching those entrapped in the false religion of Wicca.</font></p>

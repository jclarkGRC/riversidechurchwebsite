			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Back to: <a href="../../studies.htm">Studies</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="Wicca02.htm">History</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Introduction:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The phrasing of the title chosen for this study should provide a hint about the
				difficulty of trying to corral all the various aspects of this worldview.  It is a belief system which is hard to define.  The name for
				it is just one example. There is no doubt that "<i>Wicca</i>" is the most common appellation (especially these days) but it is by no
				means the only name.  Those who adhere to and practice these teachings might just as likely call it "<i>the Old Religion</i>" or
				"<i>the Craft</i>".  Some may prefer instead to speak of "<i>Paganism</i>" or "<i>Neo-paganism</i>".  Still others may like to refer
				to an "<i>Earth religion</i>", or the "<i>God and Goddess</i>" or simply about the working of "<i>Magick</i>".
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- ‘Magick’ is usually spelled with the ‘k’ by Wiccans to distinguish between a witch invoking energy from the universe
					to accomplish a goal and the ‘magic’ performed by an illusionist on a stage to entertain an audience.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the confusion and controversy doesn’t stop with the various designations for the
				Wiccan lifestyle.  There are disagreements about its true history; there are several different traditions arising from different places
				and founders; and, most of all, there are widely divergent approaches to practicing the religion.  While some of these things can be said
				of most (if not all) movements, there is a particular lack of cohesiveness in the Wiccan movement.  Steve Russo wrote that getting a
				handle on it was "<i>like trying to nail applesauce to the wall!</i>"  (<i>What’s the Deal with Wicca?</i>, p. 18.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Why bother studying Wicca?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is an underlying reason for all the ambiguity.  And this reason is connected to a
				question we should ask here at the outset of the study which is: "<i>Why examine Wiccan philosophy in the first place?</i>"  The answer
				is simply that we must do so because of the explosive growth of the movement in recent years.  There has been a dramatic increase in
				interest and an almost unconditional acceptance of Wicca and witches in American society at large and, indeed, around the world.
				Consider the following quotations regarding this matter:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Wicca is the fastest growing religion in America and the number of Wiccans is doubling every two years or so.</i> (Zimmerman and
					Gleason, <i>The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Wicca and Witchcraft</i>, p. 4 as cited by Ankerberg and Burroughs, <i>What’s the Big Deal
					About Other Religions?</i>, p.108.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>This</i> [the publication of the book <i>Witchcraft Today</i> by Gerald Gardner] <i>was to be the start of the whole re-emergence
					of Witchcraft as a religion and the eventual establishment of Wicca as an accepted everyday practice around the world.  Today it is
					the fastest growing religious movement in America.</i> (Raymond Buckland, <i>Wicca for One</i>, p. 21.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Wiccan community is growing at an exceptional rate, and is projected to be the Third Largest religion by 2012</i> (<i>Christians
					and Pagans Agree, Wicca Emerging as America’s Third Religion</i>, PRWeb, April 21, 2005 cited by Ankerberg and Burroughs, p. 108.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Wicca is huge! It’s everywhere--thanks to an extreme makeover that’s happened in the media with witchcraft.  Images of witches
					with pointy noses flying on broomsticks are gone.  Instead we’ve got Sabrina, Buffy and the Halliwell sisters.  Witches have been
					interviewed on the Oprah Winfrey Show and on cable news shows on Fox, CNN, and MSNBC.  There’s a whole new respect for witches
					today. If you’re really trying to be politically correct, you don’t talk bad about Wiccans.  The Puyallup School District of
					twenty thousand students banned Halloween parties because they wanted to avoid offending the Wiccan religion.</i> (Russo, <i>What’s
					the Deal with Wicca?</i>, p. 38. Cites MSNBC News, Oct. 22, 2004 re: Puyallup School District.)
				</blockquote>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No doubt, some may wonder and ask, "<i><b>Is</b> Wicca an actual religion?</i>"  If
				we define religion as the way a person comes to know and interact with deity, then certainly the answer must be "<i>Yes</i>" for
				Wiccans believe strongly in their ideas of the God and Goddess and act accordingly (more on that later). Also Wicca is recognized by
				the United States government.  On September 4, 1986 in the case <i>Dettmer v. Landon</i>, a Federal Court of Appeals ruled that Wiccan
				belief and practice qualifies as a constitutionally sanctioned religion and should be recognized as such by law. Since then there have
				been several more rulings in favor of the Craft including official recognition and acceptance within the U.S. armed forces.  Thus,
				Wiccan churches are tax exempt and their priests and priestesses can be chaplains and are legally allowed to officiate at weddings
				(which they call "<i>handfastings</i>" -- the first such one was performed in the United Kingdom in September, 2004).  So from the
				standpoints of both practicality and legality Wicca definitely is a religion.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Estimates of the actual number of Wiccans in America vary wildly.  A 2001 poll by the
				American Religious Identification Survey reported that at least 134,000 adults claimed to be Wiccan.  Some would say this number is
				very low because:
				<ol>
					<li>
						misunderstanding and even persecution causes many Wiccans to hide their beliefs and practices; and
					</li>
					<li>
						Wicca is extremely popular with teenaged young people who were probably not counted.
					</li>
				</ol>
				In the mid 1990’s the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance estimated that the actual number was around 750,000 making Wicca
				fifth behind Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Hinduism in the United States (cf.<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_hist.htm">
				www.religioustolerance.org/wic_hist.htm</a>).  Other estimates range from lows of 30 to 100 thousand to highs of 1.5 to 2 million.
				Accuracy in this matter is impossible but there is no doubt Wicca is a significant and growing movement.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- Are there many such groups around here?  Well, in the east Puget Sound region, as of September 3, 2009, a quick
					internet search finds six Wiccan groups conducting public meetings from Seattle/Bellevue down to Olympia.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Why is Wicca suddenly so popular?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are several specific reasons that Wiccan thought has become attractive to
				Western society in the past several decades but they all relate to one overriding factor, namely, <i>compatibility with the overall
				cultural mindset</i>.  In other words, for now, Wicca provides exactly what a great many people in America are seeking.  What are
				some of these ideas and values which are helping Wicca expand?
				<blockquote>
					<b>Environmental emphasis</b> -- Probably first and foremost among Pagans is the idea that the earth is everything. Prominent
					Wiccan Laura Wildman comments,
					<blockquote>
						<i>We practice an Earth- based religion. The earth is a living thing. It is a dirty, sticky, slimy, soft, hard, beautiful, ugly,
						wonderful place.  Everything upon it, from concrete to moldy bread, can be used as a magical tool. ... Whether our hands are
						covered with flour from kneading dough or intuitively finding the right place on a staff to adhere a stone, we make an intimate
						connection with gifts of the earth.</i> (Miria Liguana and Nina Metzner, <i>The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Wicca Craft</i>, p. xvii.)
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<b>Promise of power</b> -- The (close) second big enticement for those attracted to Wicca seems to be the offer of the ability to
					handle the issues of life.  Steve Russo comments,
					<blockquote>
						<i>Everything from cones of power to magick is at your disposal according to Wicca.  Witches believe spells can find someone to
						love you, make you glamorous, have a happy home, rid yourself of guilt and shame, keep cash flowing, take care of a crabby
						teacher or get ungrounded.</i> (<i>What’s the Deal with Wicca?</i>, p. 45.)
					</blockquote>
					While serious practitioners (e.g., Raymond Buckland) would deny that this is a proper motive for joining the movement, it is
					nevertheless promoted by the information available.  Every Wicca book I have seen has extensive “how-to” sections.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<b>Feminist flavor</b> -- The allure of power ties in with this aspect.  Over the years (decades, centuries) many women have felt
					powerless to control or change their lives.  Part of this was because society has generally been dominated by males (and in many
					cases still is).  For many women being part of a religion in which the female aspect (Goddess, Mother Earth) is dominant and they
					have personal control is extremely attractive.  This helps explain why even though men can and do participate and several of the
					key figures in the revival of Wicca were and are men, still the religion is overwhelming female in composition.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<b>Choose your own course</b> -- This, too, ties in with the power aspect.  Consider the words of Miria Liguana and Nina Metzner
					in the Introduction to <i>The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Wicca Craft</i>:
					<blockquote>
						<i>Let’s start right here by saying that the most important and unique tool for walking the path of Wicca Craftworking is <b>you</b>!
						One of the most beautiful and enduring truths about practicing Wicca is that this is a nature-based religion that encourages you
						to connect in an active and positive way with the divine energy of the source of creation: the All.</i> (p. xviii.)
					</blockquote>
					And this is not a solitary comment.  Throughout the book they emphasize that there is no one right way to do anything -- just do t
					hings the way you wish, whatever feels right.  And that is, I think, the underlying reason for all the aforementioned ambiguity
					among Wiccans.  They have a big picture but ultimately everyone has the opportunity to do things their own way.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will return to some of these themes as we explore the belief system in more depth and
				compare it to Christian thought. For now we just need to see that all of these ideas are prominent in our culture today.  The cause of
				protecting the environment has become sacred to many.  And militant feminism, while not as stridently controversial as in the 1960’s
				and 70’s, is a cause for which many still fight passionately.  It might even be said that it is only quieter because many feminist
				goals are pretty much a matter of concession these days -- it is politically correct.  With the astonishing emphasis on the (mythical)
				supernatural in books, on television and in movies these days, it should not surprise us that some people might be foolish enough take
				a closer look at obtaining an effective, secret, mystical power to deal with everyday problems.  In essence they are looking for quick
				fixes to life issues.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- Did you know that the Pagan Federation had to appoint someone to deal solely with the flood of letters in response to
					the Harry Potter phenomenon?  According to Steve Russo in <i>What’s the Deal with Wicca?</i> (p. 41) they  actually receive letters
					addressed to Headmaster Albus Dumbledore requesting admittance into Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Amazing and sad
					that people (and some very young) could want something so badly they convince themselves that a fantasy might be true.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And of course the overwhelming philosophy of our day is that everyone needs to be
				tolerant so that all can live life as they choose.  Nobody should tell us what’s right and wrong, good and bad, black and white.  There
				are no absolute standards and no one to whom we must be accountable.  We should each be completely free to chart our own course in life.
				That’s what many these days claim is true.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly Wicca is in accordance with all these views and, at this point, to some
				degree helps perpetuate them.  Instead of having to hide in shame and fear, witchcraft is now out of the (broom) closet.
				<blockquote>
					(I borrowed that one from the religious tolerance website -- thought it was funny).
				</blockquote>
				It is a religion which has apparently found its proper place and time and, therefore, is experiencing enormous growth.  Speaking of
				place and time let’s now examine how Wicca came to be and how it got here.</font></p>

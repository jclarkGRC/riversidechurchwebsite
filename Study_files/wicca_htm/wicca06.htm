			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Back To: <a href="wicca05.htm">Falling Into Wicca</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Next: <a href="Wicca07.htm">This section brought to you by the number 13</a></b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>This section brought to you by the number 3:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A second key element of the Wiccan Law, besides the Rede, which most Wiccans put much
				stock in is <b>The Rule of Three</b> (also known as the <i>Law of Return</i> or <i>The Threefold Law</i> or <i>The Law of Attraction</i>).
				Essentially, the thought is that whatever energy you send out, whether good or bad, positive or negative, will come back to you three
				times stronger.  Scott Penczak compares it to a rubber ball off a wall which ricochets back at you harder than you sent it out (but never
				mind the laws of physics).  (<i>Sons of the Goddess</i>, pp. 5-6).  Though the multiplication aspect seems unique to the Craft, the concept
				of karma is common in many religions and philosophies (e.g., the old sayings "<i>What goes around, comes around</i>." and "<i>Those who
				play with fire, eventually get burned</i>.") because we commonly see it at work in life.
				<blockquote>
					<b>Note:</b> Even Jesus made reference to this idea as a basic part of reality when, in response to Simon Peter’s attack on those
					arresting Him in the Garden of Gethsemane, in <b>Matthew 26:52</b> He said "<i> ... for all who take the sword will perish by the
					sword</i>".  Also Paul comments in <b>Galatians 6:7</b> that "<i> ... whatever a man sows, that he will also reap</i>". Thus the basic
					idea has some validity even in Christian thought.  Remember that most people will not accept a worldview that has <b>no</b>
					demonstrable truth whatsoever.  So it is, that even in Wicca, false as it is, there are nuggets of  verifiable or experiential truth
					to which its adherents cling.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Wiccans, however, the Rule of Three has an implication which is very important for
				them.  They insist that because they hold to this law it would make no sense for a genuine practitioner to ever cast a hex or a curse on
				someone because eventually it would come back to the spellcaster with much greater force.   On the other hand if a witch seeks to use her
				magick for the benefit of others, that, too, will return three times stronger.  Thus, there is much incentive to help and no reason to
				work evil.  For many Wiccans this is a powerful argument for the basic goodness (or at least the benign neutrality) of the vast majority
				of Wiccans.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- Those witches who do make a practice of working magick toward negative, hurtful or evil ends would probably be
					characterized by most other Wiccans as either being involved in the religion for the wrong reasons or not far enough along in their
					journey (i.e., immature) or perhaps they are really of some other pagan belief and are being mistaken for Wiccan.  Essentially they
					would be dismissed as being insincere in their practice of the Craft.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is worth noting that, for Wiccans, this karma thing will be played out fully in this
				life.  They would not subscribe to the notion of a judgment or consequences waiting for them after this life is over.  Even in their
				version of reincarnation (which we will see a little later), each new life is a clean slate and a fresh start with no issues hanging
				over one’s head as he or she is introduced back into this world for continuing education.
			<blockquote>
				<b>FYI</b> -- In fact some Wiccans (a minority) reject the Rule of Three precisely because of the overtones that there is some sort of a
				cosmic justice or morality.  Such witches would likely maintain a firm belief that while a decent person should not seek another person’s
				harm there is no "punishment" waiting if they do decide to take a matter into their own hands.  Such Wiccans would also likely not be big
				into a literal, personal God and Goddess but rather be more inclined to the cosmic forces philosophy.  They would likely see reality in
				terms of  "balance" rather than as a conflict between “good and evil.”</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>"We must honor The Code."</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wiccans place a great deal of emphasis on helping others (especially other Wiccans).
				Besides the obvious benefits with respect to the Rule of Three, there is another reason for this, which is the <b>Wiccan Code of
				Chivalry</b> (also called the  <i>Witch’s Code of Chivalry</i>). There is very long version which I will not share here but a shorter
				version or a summary is:
				<blockquote>
					Thou shalt have good character.<br />
					Thou shalt treat everyone with respect and dignity.<br />
					Thou shalt always read extensively.<br />
					Thou shalt always champion the Right & Good against injustice and evil.<br />
					Thou shalt actively involve in the society.<br />
					Thou shalt act with integrity, truth and justice.<br />
					Above all, Thou shalt live happily.<br />
				</blockquote>
				In his book, <i>Wiccan Beliefs and Practices</i>, Gary Cantrell comments on the Code:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Wiccan Code of Chivalry is a concept that is not specifically spelled out in the Wiccan Law, but is one that many of us have
					adopted as part of our way of life.  It is sometimes referred to as the Old Code, and is essentially derived from the medieval
					knight’s code of conduct.  That code, as we envision it today. exemplifies a deep love of the Wiccan religion and of those who
					practice that religion.  It is carried forth in some of the wording of an initiation wherein the initiate swears to defend the
					Lord and Lady and all those who love Them, in this life and all those sure to follow.  Implicit in the Code is also the promise
					to protect and assist those who may not be able to defend or care for themselves.  This implication extends beyond the limits or
					confines of our Craft world.  There may be those who need or seek our help who are not Pagan, but they are every bit as deserving
					of receiving it as any member in our Coven.  We must never get so caught up in our own spiritual realm that we ignore others around
					us.</i> (p. 48.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again we see goals and attitudes which are worthy to be adopted.  On one website where
				the entire code was displayed, in the comment area was a response by a non-Wiccan (presumably) who indicated that <i>everyone</i> should
				live by values like these.  In his book <i>Sons of the Goddess</i>, Scott Penczak does not list the Code of Chivalry as such but in
				chapter five <i>Living in the World: Roles and Responsibility</i> has a section entitled <b>Code of Honor</b> under which he mentions
				the attributes of honesty, health, courage, compassion, knowledge and respect and how witches should strive to embody these things.
				(pp. 80-82.)  He contends that witchcraft originally grew from the desire to help and heal others and so compassion should arise naturally
				from those who become part of the Craft.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Personal power</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One reason Wiccans believe they should adhere to certain proper codes of honorable
				conduct is that they believe they have access to power about which  most people have no clue.  They would agree with the old saying
				that "<i>With great power comes great responsibility</i>". and they believe they can have this ‘great power.’  This access to power is
				one of the big attractions to Wicca we referred to in the Introduction.  It is universal human experience to struggle with problems and
				want solutions.  It is just as common for someone to desire a thing and seek a way to get it. In Wicca the answer to both these issues
				is the application of magick.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The targets of Wiccan spells can be anything and everything.  A coven can decide
					as a group to work spells to aid in achieving world peace or to thwart a proposed construction project or other such "bigger" issues
					both globally or local.  Or a witch can have a personal goal or problem and apply his or her knowledge and skills toward gaining
					the desire or solving the difficulty.  In chapter seven entitled <i>Spellcraft: The Tools of Life</i> in his book <i>Sons of the
					Goddess</i>, Christopher Penczak gives instructions for making your own spells and then gives examples and hints for a wide variety
					of applications.  Among these are: <i>protection</i> spells for home, traveling, and binding someone who means to hurt you; <i>mind</i>
					spells for improving concentration, relieving stress, and improving eloquence;  <i>love</i> spells for improving your personal
					attractiveness, improving your social life, and meeting that special someone;  <i>warrior</i> spells for aiding you in competitive
					activities; <i>money</i> spells for gaining employment and for quick cash; and more. (pp. 135-158.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All the spells Penczak shares involve many different aspects including which phase
				of the moon is best for the type of spell it is, which day of the week is best, what colors are associated, and so on.  Steve Russo lists
				some of the "tools" that Wiccans use in their spell craft among which are crystals, stones, herbs, candles, colors, cords, words, chants,
				poetry, other hand-made objects and personal items.  (<i>What’s the Deal with Wicca?</i>, pp. 50-54.)  Also potions and poppets and
				symbols of power and other aids to spellcraft can be created out of these and other materials.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To show how this works generally, each of these different items has values or qualities
				assigned to it.  For instance, according to some charts, the mineral <i>fluorite</i> is associated with <i>mental acuity</i> while
				<i>cinnamon</i> can be burned to <i>stimulate intelligence</i> and the color <i>yellow</i> is also associated with <i>intelligence</i>.
				<blockquote>
					<b>Note:</b> Usually there is general consensus on the more common and popular materials (stones, herbs, colors, etc.) and their
					<b>primary</b> attributes  and what they should be used for in spell casting, potions, etc..  But there can also be widely divergent
					opinions and information according to various books and authors.  For instance almost all references and charts will assign to ‘white’
					the quality of ‘purity’ but for ‘green’ one may say ‘nature’ while another says ‘prosperity’ while yet another says ‘growth.’  Needless
					to say, this is not an exact science.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus a spell to improve one’s mental capacities might include having the fluorite on
				hand and using a yellow candle to light a pile of cinnamon while intoning a chant or rhyme to embue the mineral with energy which you then
				could carry  around with you to perpetually sharpen your wits.  This is a very simple example (and very incorrect, I’m sure) but
				nevertheless that’s the basic idea.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, as you might imagine, knowledge is the key to working magick.  That explains why
				"how-to", "step-by-step" recipes for spells, as well as glossaries of terms, and tables of minerals and herbs and their attributes, and
				charts of lunar phases, and so  forth, are more common than not in Wiccan books.  People want to find out <i>how</i> to work spells to
				get the things they need and want.  That’s also why reading and learning and recording one’s experiences is emphasized.  It all goes back
				to finding out the most effective way to raise, channel and direct the energy needed to accomplish the witch’s purpose.  The more knowledge
				and experience a witch gains, the more powerful he or she becomes.  Wiccan author Raven Grimassi shares what he calls the "<i>Eight-Fold
				Path</i>" which a practitioner must master in order to become
				<blockquote>
					<i>an Adept or Master/Magus of the Arts:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Mental discipline through fasting and physical disciplines.
						</li>
						<li>
							Development of the Will through mental imagery, visualization, and meditation.
						</li>
						<li>
							Proper controlled use of drugs (hemp, peyote, mescaline, alcohol).
						</li>
						<li>
							Personal power, thought projection, raising and drawing power.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Keys: ritual knowledge and practice. Use of enchantments, spells, symbols, and charms.
						</li>
						<li>
							Psychic development and dream control.
						</li>
						<li>
							Rising upon the Planes.  Astral projection and mental projection.
						</li>
						<li>
							Sex Magic, sensuality, and eroticism. ...
						</li>
					</ol>
					The Eight-Fold path is a guideline to those who are interested in what the ancients believed to be the necessary steps to personal
					power.  A personal study of each of these aspects will provide the magician with the tools through which deeper levels of magickal
					knowledge can be obtained.</i>  (<i>Wiccan Magick: Inner Teachings of the Craft</i>, pp. 186, 189.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In essence, Wicca teaches that each person has the power to create his own reality
				through witchcraft.  Steve Russo cites Gavin and Yvonne Frost who write:
				<blockquote>
					<i>No one, least of all kindly Jesus or gentle Buddha, expects or wants you to live in abject misery.  So what is wrong with your life
					that needs fixing today?  Name it; then fix it.  Consider what spell will be useful, get the equipment you will need, and get out of
					that chair and do it.  We reminded you earlier that the gods help those who help themselves.  You must put something into motion.
					It only takes a small but simple push; but once it is in motion, the result will be unbelievable.  Use the following affirmation:
					Witchcraft power, give me a new life.</i>  (The <i>Magic Power of White Witchcraft</i>, p. 230 as cited in <i>What’s the Deal with
					Wicca?</i>, p. 61)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Happy holy-days to you</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A large part of Wiccan experience is the observation of days of power: <b>esbats</b>
				and <b>sabbats</b>.  An <b>esbat</b>, sometimes known as the <i>Full Moon Ritual</i> is observed on ... you guessed it ... nights
				when there is a full moon.  A full moon happens every 28½ days so there are at least thirteen esbats in a given year.  This is seen as
				an especially powerful time for magick because of the power of the moon, which is associated with the Goddess, is at its peak.  It is
				seen as a time for work since the opportunity for so much more energy is available.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- Steve Russo comments that Wiccans see the moon as a mystic source of energy because it reflects light (i.e., power) from
					a hidden sun and because the moon has a strong effect on such things as tides and the cycles of women and animals (<i>What’s the Deal
					with Wicca?</i>, p. 55).   It is a widely shared belief among police officers and ER workers that nights with full moons will usually
					be busy because people tend to behave more erratically on such occasions.  This is one of those interesting, validating factoids that
					give Wiccans confidence in their worldview.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is during the time of the full moon that Wiccans will perform an important ritual
				many call "<i>Drawing Down the Moon</i>" which is intended to charge the participant with divine energy.  Miria Liguana and Nina Metzner
				share a simple ceremony for one or more to accomplish this which I summarize.
				<blockquote>
					First, prepare/purify yourself with a self-blessing and/or a ritual bath. Find a quiet place where the full moon can be seen clearly
					and easily.  Cast a sacred circle in which to perform the ritual.  Read/recite out loud a version of <i>The Charge of the Goddess</i>
					and focus on its meaning for the purpose of grounding and centering yourself.  Then take out your special ‘Moon mirror’ (a mirror
					blessed, charged and used only for Wicca rituals) and hold it so the moon is reflected in it. Speak the following chant,
					<blockquote>
						“You are the Mother of the moon.<br />
						You are the Goddess strong and bright.<br />
						I am the sister (or brother) of the moon.<br />
						Let me be filled with Goddess light.”<br />
					</blockquote>
					and let yourself be filled with the Lady’s energy.  The ritual is over when you can feel power build within and you feel <i>‘touched
					by the Lady'.</i>  Then it is a good time to cast other spells as you wish and conclude by discharging the energy and removing the
					circle, etc. as usual. (<i>The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Wicca Craft</i>, pp. 60-61.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- <i>The Charge of the Goddess</i> is a well loved poem written from the perspective of the Goddess in which she instructs
					and makes promises to those who follow her ways.   Because of what it contains and because it is used so frequently it is also an
					important anthem for Wiccans.  Ashleen O’Gaea calls it "<i>... the Charge that guides our understanding of the world and our
					interpretation of what happens in it</i>". (<i>The Family Wicca Book</i>, p. 185.) There are several versions both older and modern,
					here is a popular shorter one written in 1897 by Charles G. Leland copied from www.fortunecity.com on a page entitled <i>The Sacred Moon
					Circle</i>:
					<blockquote>
						Whenever you have need of anything,<br />
						one in the month and be it better when the moon is full,<br />
						then shall you assemble in some secret place and adore<br />
						the spirit of me, who am the Queen of all witches.<br />
						When I have departed from this world,<br />
						Whenever you have need of anything,<br />
						Once a month, and when the moon is full,<br />
						Ye shall assemble in some desert place<br />
						or in a forest all together join<br />
						To adore the potent spirit of your Queen<br />
						My mother, great Diana, She who fain<br />
						Would learn all sorcery yet has not won<br />
						Its deepest secrets, then my mother will<br />
						Teach her, in truth all things as yet unknown.<br />
						And ye shall all be freed from slavery,<br />
						And so ye shall be free in everything,<br />
						And as a sign that ye are truly free,<br />
						Ye shall be naked in your rites, both men<br />
						And women also: this shall last until<br />
						The last of your oppressors are dead.<br />
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The esbat, then, is the likely source of the classic stereotype of a coven gathering
				together in a secluded place with the full moon looming, for the purpose of brewing potions, casting spells and wildly celebrating in
				their worship of pagan, nature gods.  While the accuracy of the stereotype would likely depend on the character of the coven, there is
				some kernel of truth to it.  But since we are speaking of stereotypes this is as good a place as any to point out a false one, namely,
				the belief that Wiccans worship Satan.  They do not.  In fact they do not even believe he exists since they think he is a construct of
				early Christian authorities to frighten the general populace in order to keep them in line.  Still many people outside Wiccan circles
				often confuse Satanism and witchcraft as being the same.  Since witches do not want to have much, if anything, to do with Christian
				doctrine and they certainly do not conceive of themselves as evil, this can be a sore point for them.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- Of course Christians realize that whether or not they actually directly believe in or worship Satan himself is beside
					the point with regard to their eternal destiny.  Any religious practice or belief which distracts someone from the one true God as
					revealed in the Bible and salvation through Jesus Christ is equally useful for the devil.  One does not have to believe in Satan to
					serve his purpose, which is to destroy as many of God’s highest creation, mankind, as possible by separating them from the Lord.
					</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Wiccans also work magick during the other parts of the lunar cycle as well and the
				position of the moon affects the kind of spells they cast.  Christopher Penczak advises that while many factors can come into play when
				trying to decide the best time to work a certain magick, one extremely important rule is "<i>pay attention to the Moon</i>!" He asserts
				that as the moon affects tides coming in and going out, so magickal energy is pushed in and pulled out by the moon’s phases.  From new
				moon to full moon the power is rising until it reaches its peak and then it begins fading as it wanes back from full to new.  (<i>Sons
				of the Goddess</i>, p. 134.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Liguana and Metzner concur and offer advice about what sort of magick is best done under
			the various phases of the moon.  According to them (<i>The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Wicca Craft</i>, p. 52.):
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>new moons</b> (which cannot be seen) are especially appropriate for magick pertaining to beginnings or fresh starts (e.g.,
					beginning a new job or career, trying to have a baby, starting a relationship, taking on a project or any new endeavor);
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>waxing moons</b> (look like a backward ‘C’) are favorable for magick pertaining to growth and positive changes so casting spells
					to attract good things to you (e.g., love, wealth, luck, knowledge) are powerful at this time;
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>full moons</b> are times when things come to fruition or fulfillment thus this is when your heart’s desire can be realized.  The
					authors recommend that during the three days before, during, and the three days after the full moon, a witch should focus on casting
					spells invoking power, strength, healing and nurturing;
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>waning moons</b> (look like a ‘C’) are times of ending or releasing things so banishing or completing magick is most powerful at this
					time (e.g., ending a bad relationship, losing weight, getting out of an encumbering responsibility).
				</li>
			</ul>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides the esbats, monthly observances especially related to the phases of the moon,
				Wiccans also celebrate eight solar holidays generally referred to as <b>sabbats</b>.  Just as esbats (and the moon) are associated with
				the Goddess, so are sabbats identified with the God and, in fact, tell a bit of his story.  There are two types: the <b>greater sabbats</b>,
				sometimes referred to as being at the "<i>cross quarters</i>" of  the year, which are based on old Celtic “fire festivals” which celebrated
				the cycles of agriculture; and the <b>lesser</b> which are celebrations based on the seasonal solstices and equinoxes, or the journey of
				the sun in a given year.  To Wiccans, all of them together depict the cycle of life: birth, growth, maturity, old age and death.  Below
				are two sample graphics for the “Wheel of the Year”:</font></p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<img src="wiccapictures/wheel01.jpg" alt="Wheel 01"></img>
					</td>
					<td>
						<img src="wiccapictures/wheel02.jpg" alt="Wheel 01"></img>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each of the sabbats has symbolic meaning to witches, that is, there is a reason (or
				reasons) for their celebration at each point of the wheel.  The following information about each particular sabbat is a consensus from
				several sources:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Yule</b>, being winter solstice, takes place on the day with the least amount of sunlight.  However, from then on, daily
						sunlight begins to slowly increase.  This is celebrated as the birth (or rebirth) of the God through the work of the Goddess.
						Thus life emerges and perseveres in the midst of darkness and death. This explains the popular use of holly, mistletoe, and
						evergreen at this season.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Imbolc</b> is the first of three sabbats of increasingly growing light.  The Goddess has recovered from giving birth to the
						God, regains her youth and becomes a maiden again.  The God is still a child.  It is a celebration of early stirrings and the
						renewal of life and fertility.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Ostara</b> is the vernal equinox and now sunlight and darkness are equal in duration with the light beginning to prevail.
						Spring and fertility are here and the Lord, now a youth, and the Lady, still a maiden, come together as lovers.  The earth is
						becoming green and it is at this time that the God is seen as the <i>Green Man</i> or <i>Jack in the Green</i>.  Eggs, symbolic
						of life, are decorated and incorporated into the celebration.
					</li>
					<li>
						Beltane is the second Celtic fire festival and third spring festival.  The Lord is now mature and is the Lady’s partner and
						champion.  She assumes her aspect as a young mother.   The earth’s fertility and the abundance of life is in full evidence as
						summer’s almost here.  Bonfires and Maypole dances are common during the observance of this sabbat.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Litha</b> (also known as Midsummer) is the summer solstice.  Sunlight now dominates the day and the God is at the peak of his
						power while the Goddess is now the mother of many children.  However, it is also the turning of the tide and now darkness will
						progressively gain strength as the year ages.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Lammas</b> is the third of the "cross quarter" sabbats and the first of three harvest festivals.  The Lord is growing older
						and is losing strength while the Lady is also aging and moves from mother to crone.  For now there is still plenty of light and
						the harvest is abundant but people’s minds begin to turn to thoughts of preparing for winter.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Mabon</b> is the autumnal equinox and the second harvest festival.  It equates to a Wiccan version of Thanksgiving.  Light is
						now fading and the God is preparing to die.  The Goddess is mourning his passing and her fall colors denote the withdrawal of her
						power from the land.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Samhain</b> is the most important of the eight sabbats for Wiccans.  It is the last harvest festival and is both the beginning
						and the end of the Wheel of the Year.  The Lord is now in the underworld and the earth is ruled by the Horned God of the hunt until
						his rebirth at Yule.  The Goddess is fully in her crone aspect and the land seems barren.  Death is a central aspect of this sabbat
						and Wiccans take time to reflect on the passing of those they have known.  Of course this date is also the more widely celebrated
						Halloween similarly associated with dark supernatural forces and beings.</ul></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How a witch celebrates a sabbat is up to her.  Some may gather with members of their
				covens for a somber ceremony while others may plan a raucous party or there may be a little of both.  Some solitary witches just do their
				own thing quietly and without much fanfare.  There will almost always be some sort of ritual followed by the customary "cakes and wine
				(or ale)" observance.  Steve Russo comments on how Wiccans see their holy days:
				<blockquote>
					<i>... Sabbats can be seen on three levels.  First, they are times of religious worship for Wiccans to connect with the god and goddess.
					Second, Wiccans use these days of power for working their magick to help, heal, comfort, and protect their friends and loved ones.
					They receive help in the process from other deities.  Third, these are times of celebration.  Once the worship and work has been
					completed, it’s party time!</i> (<i>What’s the Deal with Wicca?</i>, p. 56.)

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The final set of Wiccan teachings I will share was actually formulated and not, like the
				others, seemingly a product of tradition, speculation and evolution.  These ideas are called the <b>Thirteen Principles of Wicca</b>.
				They were developed and adopted at the April, 1974 meeting of the <i>Council of American Witches</i> (Burroughs and Alupoaicei note that
				this organization disbanded soon after and no longer exists).  Once again I found two different specimens. This longer version was found
				at <i>www.mysticmooncoven.org</i>:
				<ol>
					<li>
						We practice rites to attune ourselves with the natural rhythm of life forces marked by the phases of the Moon and the seasonal
						Quarters and Cross Quarters.
					</li>
					<li>
						We recognize that our intelligence gives us a unique responsibility toward our environment. We seek to live in harmony with Nature,
						in ecological balance offering fulfillment and consciousness within an evolutionary concept.
					</li>
					<li>
						We acknowledge a depth of power far greater than that apparent to the average person. Because it is far greater than ordinary it
						is sometimes called supernatural, but we see it as lying within that which is naturally potential to all.
					</li>
					<li>
						We conceive of the Creative Power in the universe as manifesting through polarity ~ as masculine and feminine ~ and that this same
						Creative Power lies in all people, and functions through the interaction of the masculine and feminine. We value neither above
						the other, knowing each to be supportive to each other. We value sex as pleasure, as the symbol and embodiment of life, and as
						one of the sources of energies used in magickal practice and religious worship.
					</li>
					<li>
						We recognize both outer worlds and inner, or psychological, worlds sometimes known as the Spiritual World, the Collective
						Unconscious, Inner Planes, etc. ~ and we see in the interaction of these two dimensions the basis for paranormal phenomena
						and magickal exercises. We neglect neither dimension for the other, seeing both as necessary for our fulfillment.
					</li>
					<li>
						We do not recognize any authoritarian hierarchy, but do honor those who teach, respect those who share their greater knowledge
						and wisdom, and acknowledge those who have courageously given of themselves in leadership.
					</li>
					<li>
						We see religion, magick, and wisdom in living as being united in the way one views the world and lives within it ~a world view
						and philosophy of life which we identify as Witchcraft.
					</li>
					<li>
						Calling oneself "Witch" does not make a Witch - but neither does heredity itself, not the collecting of titles, degrees, and
						initiations. A Witch seeks to control the forces within her/himself that make life possible in order to live wisely and well
						without harm to others and in harmony with Nature.
					</li>
					<li>
						We believe in the affirmation and fulfillment of life in a continuation of evolution and development of consciousness giving
						meaning to the Universe we know and our personal role within it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Our only animosity towards Christianity, or towards any other religion or philosophy of life, is to the extent that its
						institutions have claimed to be "the only way", and have sought to deny freedom to others and to suppress other ways of
						religious practice and belief.
					</li>
					<li>
						As American {Or World-Wide!} Witches, we are not threatened by debates on the history of the Craft, the origins of various
						terms, the legitimacy of various aspects of different traditions. We are concerned with our present and our future.
					</li>
					<li>
						We do not accept the concept of absolute evil, nor do we worship any entity known as Satan or the Devil, as defined by the
						Christian tradition. We do not seek power through the sufferings of others, nor accept that personal benefit can be derived
						only by denial to another.
					</li>
					<li>
						We believe that we should seek within Nature that which is contributory to our health and well-being.
					</li>
				</ol>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A shorter version cited by Burroughs and Alupoaicei as also being developed at that
				1974 meeting goes this way:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Know yourself.
					</li>
					<li>
						Know your Craft.
					</li>
					<li>
						Learn.
					</li>
					<li>
						Apply knowledge with wisdom.
					</li>
					<li>
						Achieve balance.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep your words in good order.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep your thoughts in good order.
					</li>
					<li>
						Celebrate life.
					</li>
					<li>
						Attune with the cycle of the earth.
					</li>
					<li>
						Breathe and eat correctly.
					</li>
					<li>
						Exercise the body.
					</li>
					<li>
						Meditate.
					</li>
					<li>
						Honor the Goddess and the God.
					</li>

				as cited in <i>Generation Hex</i>, p. 45)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two versions contain some similar ideas but seem to be addressed to different
				audiences (Perhaps they were both developed separately for different purposes at the same meeting?  If so, the  supposedly unlucky
				number thirteen seems to have had much meaning to them).  The second one appears to be a series of brief admonitions to the practitioners
				themselves regarding how best to proceed in becoming a witch.  The first one obviously has much more detailed information and could be
				seen as a manifesto or a declaration of Wiccan thought.  It is a very good summary of their belief system and, though room must be made
				for individual variations, probably most Wiccans would be in agreement with the principles contained in the thirteen statements.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One last item to quickly note is the symbol which seems to be the most popular among
				Wiccans, which is, the <b>pentacle</b>.  As can be seen below, a pentacle is a pentagram circumscribed within a circle.  Other pagan
				groups and religions also use the pentagram and pentacle so they are not exclusive to Wicca as, in contrast, the cross is to Christianity
				or the star of David is to Judaism.  Nevertheless witches make heavy use of it and associate their own meanings to it.</font></p>

			</table>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The five points of the star are usually seen as the five elements of air, earth, fire,
				water and akasha (spirit).  But some liken them to the five senses, or a hand (five fingers), or the human body.  It all depends on how
				the pentacle or pentagram is being used.  The circle is often seen as the never ending circle of love enclosing the five elements or
				senses.  Or it is sometimes said to symbolize the ‘sixth sense’ (which witches wistfully want in the worst way).  According to Wiccan
				belief and practice the symbol has power in itself.  If, in a spell or ritual, a pentacle or pentagram is drawn starting at the top it
				can be used to invoke (or draw) power or the elements to oneself while starting at the bottom banishes them.  Inscribing a pentacle on
				an object is one way (among many) of charging the object to make it a working tool of the Craft.  A pentacle on a disk or as a piece of
				jewelry may be counted a powerful talisman or amulet, or it can simply be for decoration.  It is very common for witches to wear or have
				a pentacle of some sort on their persons for protection and as affirmation of their beliefs.  However, since many Wiccans believe pentacles
				are more powerful when hidden, it is quite possible she may not display it openly.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are other symbols associated with Wicca (e.g., ‘sacred spirals’ and ‘equal-armed
				crosses’) with their own respective meanings and uses but we will not take time or space to discuss them here.  Next we will do an overview
				of what Wicca teaches or believes about various Christian doctrines.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Compared to Christianity</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having now a decent overview of Wiccan beliefs this is as good a time as any to take a
				look at their ideas about Christian doctrine.  We have seen that they reject  Bible-based, Christian beliefs about <b>God</b>.  They
				combine monistic, pantheistic, polytheistic thought and deny the one triune God who is creator of all,  separate from His creation yet
				actively involved in it.  We have discussed this enough.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do they think about the historic figure named <b>Jesus</b>?  In general they have
				a positive, though incorrect, view of Jesus.  They recognize Him as a great religious figure and even an enlightened one able to foretell
				the future (i.e., He was a  prophet).  He is considered by some as a great and misunderstood wizard.  However Wiccans would deny and see
				as naive the biblical claims about Jesus (e.g., His virgin birth, His status as God the Son, His resurrection, etc.).  As Wiccans see it,
				even though His life and death inspired a world religion, followers of Jesus, the Christians, have badly missed the point of His teachings
				and in doing so have caused much harm.  In practice, most Wiccans spend little time considering the implications of Jesus’ teachings.
				Remember, they are about the present and the future, not the past.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Likewise the <b>Bible</b> is usually recognized as an important historical and religious
				book.  Most Wiccans would affirm that there is truth in its pages.  However, at best, it is one of many such works and not uniquely the
				Word of God as Christians believe.  Some Wiccans are wary of the Bible and see it as being used as an excuse by fanatics to unjustly
				persecute them.  Wicca has no single authoritative source of truth.  They may certainly recognize certain books as valuable but they are
				not required to buy into all the teachings of any literary work.  They can pick and choose their own ‘truth’ according to their own
				tastes.  In the end, the most important book to any witch is his or her own personal <i>Book of Shadows</i>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Sin</b> is defined by Wicca as an action that harms others rather than an offense
				which is by nature evil because of objective standards of right and wrong.  Thus <i>any</i> activity can be acceptable as long as no one
				gets hurt by it.  They reject the Christian view that God’s laws in the Bible are the definitive benchmarks of mankind’s behavior.  While
				they recognize that people and things (and even the gods) can have a ‘darker’ nature or a ‘lighter’ nature, they are hesitant to assign
				labels such as ‘good’ and ‘evil.’  In their eyes, the only ‘evil’ that truly exists is when certain people try to control and harm other
				people (or the environment) and things get knocked out of balance.  Wiccans, in trying to restore that all-important balance, might then,
				in that context, think of themselves as agents of ‘good’. Since there is no such thing as sin, according to Wicca, there is therefore
				also no need of <b>salvation</b>.  Wiccans do not believe there is a need for things like atone- ment and repentance as Christians
				recognize.  The following quotation illustrates this:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Valerie Voight’s words are particularly blunt at this point. She states, ‘We are aware of our own goodness and strength, and we are
					not afraid to admit it. We are not sinners and we know it. We don’t have a Devil to blame our mistakes on and we need no Savior to
					save us from a non-existent Hell.’</i> (<i>Witchcraft Today, Book One: The Modern Craft Movement</i>, p. 173 as cited from the website
					<i>www.arcapologetics.org</i>)
				</blockquote>
				Thus they do not see mankind as wrong<i>doers</i> per se, but rather, they are simply wrong<i>headed</i>.  People need to be educated
				about the nature of reality.  See another quotation, this time from Raymond Buckland:
				<blockquote>
					<i>... for its own evolution, it is necessary that the soul experience all things in life. It seems the most sensible, most logical
					explanation of much that is found in life. Why should one person be born into a rich family and another into poverty? Why should one
					be born crippled, and another fit and strong ... if not because we must all eventually experience all things.</i> (<i>Complete Book of
					Witchcraft</i>, pp. 25-26 as cited from the website <i>www.arcapologetics.org</i>)
				</blockquote>
				This education happens naturally.  Wiccans believe that this present life is only one of many that each person will go through.  In a
				given life a person will learn certain truths.  At death the essence of that person, the real spirit being will go to a spirit place to
				ponder what he or she has learned and to wait for another chance on the wheel of life.  So it’s not about reconciliation with the Lord
				God, it’s about repeated reincarnation so as to experience and learn everything a person possibly can.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That thought brings us to the closest thing to a teaching on the <b>afterlife</b> that
				Wicca has.  When a person has experienced and grown and learned all about life that he or she possibly can, he or she is then allowed to
				stay in the <i>Summerland</i>.  This is the Wiccan concept of heaven.  It is a pleasant place, green and sunny, peaceful and beautiful.
				It is also thought to be the place where the spirits of people rest between incarnations.  As seen above, there is no Wiccan concept of
				a place of punishment in the afterlife like the Christian doctrine of hell.  Again, according to the teachings of the Craft, there is
				no inherent evil in humanity to punish, rather it is simply a matter of learning and growing to a full understanding of the true nature
				of reality.</font></p>

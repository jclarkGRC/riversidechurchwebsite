			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Genesis of the ‘God and Goddess’:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though Wiccans would maintain that the God and Goddess have been around for a very long
				time, most, it would seem, do not believe that the Lord and Lady are eternal.  In other words, there was a time when they did not exist.
				What was there?  Christopher Penczak speak to this,
				<blockquote>
					<i>Most witches believe that in the beginning there was a void or chaos and from this nothingness rose the first form of the Goddess and
					God, who then created all things and set the stars in motion with their love.</i>
					(<i>Sons of the Goddess</i>, p. 20)
				</blockquote>
				But the explanatory quotation from Penczak is a summary statement of sorts.  To my knowledge, all Wiccans believe the Goddess came
				into being first.  How? This is not explained nor even claimed to be known.  This is not surprising as most religions contain at least
				a few unknowable mysteries.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- For those Wiccans who do not believe in the Goddess as an actual personal being, the question of how the Goddess came
					to be is not important at all.  Since, to them she only represents natural forces, theories such as the Big Bang and evolution suffice.
					To such people, energy and matter are seen as eternal and they develop as a matter of course.  These Wiccans may allow for some degree
					of intelligence or guidance on a cosmic scale but it would be impersonal -- just some sort of "<i>forces of good</i>" kind of
					thing.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems to be assumed (at least according to Penczak) that she coalesced in some manner
				from the chaos of the universe and then exerted her will to bring about order and life.  Because of her primacy, it seems that in their
				minds, she is foremost.  The Lady is revered and worshipped much more widely and frequently than the Lord.  She is described in glowing
				terms by her devotees:
				<blockquote>
					<i>She is the source of fertility, endless wisdom, and loving caresses.  As the Wicca know her, She is often of three aspects: the
					Maiden, the Mother and the Crone, symbolized in the waxing, full and waning of the Moon.  She is at once the unploughed field, the
					full harvest and the dormant frost-covered Earth.  She gives birth in abundance ... Since the Goddess is nature, all nature, She is
					both the Temptress and the Crone; the tornado and the fresh spring rain; the cradle and the grave ... No matter how we envision Her, 1
					She is omnipresent, changeless, eternal.</i> (Scott Cunningham, <i>Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner</i>, p. 5 as cited by
					Burroughs and Alupoaicei, <i>Generation Hex</i>, p. 63.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Most witches focus on the Goddess.  She is the first mother, the star goddess of creation, and the Earth goddess who is the planet we
					live on.  She has many names, but one of her most popular, as Mother Earth, is Gaia.  Gaia. also spelled Gaea, is the name the Greeks
					used.  The Goddess is also embodied by the Moon and has many names, such as Artemis, Diana, Luna, and Selene.  Modern pagans think of
					the Goddess in triple form, as maiden, mother, and crone.  She can be seen as the seasons -- going to the underworld in the winter as
					the crone and being reborn again as the maiden in the spring.  She is seen in the phases of the Moon, from first crescent as maiden,
					Full Moon as mother, and darkening Moon as crone.  Others think of the Triple Goddess in locations -- the Moon and stars as maiden,
					the Earth as mother, and the underworld as the crone.  Some images of the Goddess are grand and can’t be put into categories.  Her
					other names are Danu, the Morrigan, Isis, Hecate, Freya, and Yemeja.  Each is different but each is part of the same source, like
					many rivers running off one mountain.  Even though she has many faces, the mother is eternal.  She is the creator of all.  Our bodies a
					re made from her body.  Our blood is from her water.  She is the force of life that connects and animates all things.  She is Mother
					Nature, Mother Earth, and Mother Universe, all at the same time.</i>  (Penczak, <i>Sons of the Goddess</i>, pp. 17-18.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In point of fact, according to most Wiccan teaching, she is the mother of the God.  At
				some point she gave birth to a son who grew up to be her partner.  Listen as Penczak continues:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Goddess created the God as her companion and consort.  The God starts his life as her child and grows to be her love.  The God
					becomes her champion, her warrior or knight.  He soon claims his responsibility as king, loyal to his queen.  He grows to be the
					wizard, the wise man, and the healer.  Like the Goddess, the God appears in many forms and comes in many faces.  He is the sky,
					king of clouds and storms, looking down upon the world and his children.  Some would call him Zeus, Jupiter, or Thor.  He is god of
					the Sun and solar light.  Then his name might be Apollo, Baldur, or Ra.  He is the Green Man or Jack of the Green and god of the
					harvest.  He is the horned animal god, stag-horned Cernunnos to the Celts and the goat-horned Pan to the Greeks.  He is the god of
					the dead, like Hades or Osiris.  All of these names and forms are loved by modern witches.</i>  (<i>Sons of the Goddess</i>, p. 18.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Knowing this helps us understand why the focus of Wicca is mainly on the Lady rather
				than the Lord.  He has vital roles and at times is even dominant over her (e.g., in winter the God is seen as ascendant over the
				Goddess), yet always plays second fiddle, it seems.  Many practitioners of the Craft would deny this and insist that both Lord and Lady
				are central.  Burroughs and Alupoaicei again quote Wiccan author Scott Cunningham who asserts this idea:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Goddess and God are equal; neither is higher or more deserving of respect.  Though some Wiccans focus their rituals toward the
					Goddess and seem to forget the God entirely, this is a reaction to centuries of stifling patriarchal religion, and the loss of
					acknowledgement of the feminine aspect of Divinity.  Religion based entirely on feminine energy, however is as unbalanced and
					unnatural as one totally masculine in focus.  The ideal is a perfect balance of the two.  The Goddess and God are equal,
					complementary.</i>  (<i>Generation Hex</i>, p. 64.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite these theoretical sentiments (probably commonly held by Wiccans), Marla
				Alupoaicei notes that in her conversations with the witches she knows, the Horned God is rarely mentioned while the Goddess is referred
				to often (<i>Generation Hex</i>, p. 64).  That has also been my personal experience while researching various Wiccan texts.  I find that
				while the Lord is generally acknowledged by Wiccan authors, the rituals, chants and prayers they share with the reader mostly address
				the Lady.  She is the one they seek and to whom they appeal.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of what real use is the God then?  Mostly, he seems to provide what is seen in nature,
				that is, the necessity of the presence of both male and female to be able to reproduce offspring.
				<blockquote>
					<b>Note:</b> Of course the Goddess was able to give birth to the God without any apparent help.  Another mystery it seems.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Together they were (and are) able to create life and order the universe in its
				cyclical patterns.  Christopher Penczak elaborates:
				<blockquote>
					The God is the force of life too.  He is the seed, and the Goddess is the fertile Earth.  She creates and destroys, but he is the
					spark that ignites her flame.  The God is the force that seeks out magick, while the Goddess is magick and mystery.  (<i>Sons of
					the Goddess</i>, p. 19.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wicca, at its core, follows in the path of the old fertility religions in which sex
				had a central role.  While many witches (perhaps the majority) do not seem to emphasize or practice that particular aspect personally,
				it is nevertheless present because of the underlying theology.  Further, though maybe not overtly and forcefully presented, these ideas
				are accepted and acknowledged widely by those involved.  Several of the various instruments and tools used in the rituals represent
				masculine and feminine characteristics.  A major premise of A.J. Drew’s book <i>Wicca for Couples</i> is that when Wiccans ignore this
				part of the Craft,  they leave out a key component and thus lose the power (energy) that such activity produces.  When sexual freedom
				<i>is</i> taught and practiced, the adherents who do so justify it as a normal process and part of nature.  And since, Nature is divine,
				as it were, how could it be wrong?  Followers of Jesus and others who condemn this kind of activity and call it promiscuity are ridiculed
				as self-righteous, uptight, judgmental, and so on.  The point here is that while much of Wicca addresses everyday life and for the most
				part may seem benign, it is impossible to completely ignore the underpinnings of the ancient fertility cults upon which it is built.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Mythological mania</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of ancient religions we will conclude by quickly noting once more all the
				various mythological gods and goddesses whose names have either been assigned to the Lord and Lady or are seen as beings who were produced
				by them as underlings or intermediaries between humankind and the Goddess and God.  This, too, seems to be a major aspect of Wicca.
				Followers of the Craft seem to draw comfort because these mythical beings are products of ancient cultures and if it is old, it has to be
				true ... right?  Ann Moura in her book <i>Origins of Modern Witchcraft</i> attempts to trace the roots of Wicca all the way back through
				many ancient cultures and their belief systems <i>as if these mythological beings really existed</i>.  It hardly seems necessary to point
				out that in the hundreds of years prior to the 1950’s almost nobody gave a second thought to these names and tales except as interesting
				literature.  To suddenly see figures like Zeus, Ra, Artemis, Thor, Diana, Osiris, Aphrodite, etc. bandied about as if they were real
				beings and not the inventions of people is, frankly, disconcerting.  To read of people actually praying to them is worse -- it is
				frightening.</font></p>

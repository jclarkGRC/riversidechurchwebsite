			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we begin to examine what Wiccans believe and do in practicing their religion it is
				likely that many of the terms they use will be completely unfamiliar to us since  most followers of Jesus Christ are so far outside the
				circle of the Craft.  Therefore it might behoove us to begin this section with a glossary so that we can familiarize ourselves with some
				of the words and concepts.  It will also allow us to proceed in the study without having to explain every new term we encounter -- rather
				we can simply refer back to the glossary for a reminder.  The following list of words and definitions is a compilation and adaptation from
				three primary sources: Raymond Buckland’s <i>Wicca for One</i> (pp. 231-244), Liguana and Metzner’s <i>The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Wicca
				Craft</i> (pp. 279-283) and Steve Russo’s <i>What’s the Deal with Wicca</i> (pp. 171-186).  The perspective of a practicing Wiccan is
				used.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i><b>Affirmation</b></i> -- a positive declaration, usually short, describing something you want to happen or become true in
						your life. Repeating the word or phrase or sentence frequently empowers and reinforces the sub-consciousness and helps bring to
						pass the thing desired.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Akasha</b></i> --  a Sanskrit word often used to describe the concept of ‘Spirit.’  Some Wiccans believe ‘Spirit’ is the
						fifth element which permeates the universe and ties the other four elements (air, earth, fire and water) together in a cohesive
						way.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Altar</b></i> --  a working surface upon which the tools used for rituals and the working of magick are placed.  Altars
						can be any shape (square, round, oval, etc.); they can be fixed or portable, small or large, plain or elaborate.  However,
						whatever form it takes, the witch should not dishonor it by inattentiveness.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Amulet</b></i> --  an item which has magickally empowered for one’s protection (i.e., keeping negative energy at bay).
						It is usually some sort of natural object (e.g., a rock, crystal, four-leaf clover, etc.).
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Asperge</b></i> -- to sprinkle an object with sacred or holy water in order to consecrate it for future use in a ritual
						or as part of the ritual itself.  One can employ an instrument (an aspergillum) or simply use her fingers.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Astral</b></i> -- a plane of existence, invisible to the naked eye, which nevertheless coexists with the physical plane.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Astral body</b></i> -- the etheric copy of the physical body of all living things which extends slightly beyond the
						physical body. Witches with psychic ability can see this outline.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Astral projection</b></i> -- when the etheric or astral body separates from the physical body and moves about the astral plane.  This
						may involve going to other places and times.  Some believe our dreams are actually memories of astral travel.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Athame</b></i> (a'-tha-may) -- a two-edged knife.  Handles, styles and markings vary.  It is used as a sacred tool in many
						rituals as a means of directing one’s personal power or energy.  It cuts on the astral or spiritual plane not the physical.  It is
						also used to symbolize the Horned God (male aspect of the “All”).
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Augury</b></i> -- the art or practice of divination (foretelling the future) through the interpretation of signs and omens.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Aura</b></i> -- the astral outline of a physical body visible only to those with psychic ability.  The aura indicates the
						exact position of the living being’s astral body with regard to its physical body.  The color of a person’s aura may change
						depending on factors such as health, emotional mood, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Balefire</b></i> -- a traditional bonfire lit for religious celebratory purposes usually during Sabbats.  Can be smaller
						and employed to work magick.

						destroy.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Banishing</b></i> -- using your personal energy and will (magick) to make something go away (usually from a sacred circle).
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Bell</b></i> -- a common tool used in rituals.  Its purpose is to alter the vibrational attributes within a consecrated
						area (sacred circle).
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Beltane</b></i> -- one of the major Sabbats.  The last of the three fertility rituals which occurs April 30 into May 1.
						It is also known as May Eve or Roodmas.  It is the celebration of the sun finally coming fully into dominance  (i.e., winter
						to summer) and an emphasis shift from god to goddess.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Besom</b></i> -- a ceremonial broom used as a tool in rituals.  It is often employed to sweep negative energy out of a
						sacred circle.  It is also used in handfasting (wedding) ceremonies where the couple jumps over the broom.  Some witches use
						it in lieu of a staff.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Boleen (or boline)</b></i> -- a knife with a curved blade used to cut things on the physical plane (as opposed to the
						<i>athame</i>).  It is used primarily for vegetables/herbs for recipes and potions.  It is also used to inscribe markings and symbols
						into sacred objects.   It can be used to cut other ritual materials and even wands.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Bind</b></i> -- the act of completing the casting of a spell so that it will do its work independently of the one weaving
						the spell.

					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Book of Shadows</b></i> -- a witch’s personal journal named so with regard to the times of persecution when witches had to
						meet "in the shadows".  It contains her collection of rituals, spells, revelations, records, wisdom, teachings and rules.  It
						is always handwritten with some witches even making their own paper and bindings. Some groups have a Book of Shadows for their
						coven kept by the High Priestess.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Cakes and Ale (or Wine)</b></i> -- a communal offering of thanks to God and Goddess for the necessities of life in which
						each participant in a ritual is given cake and beverage to consume.
					</li>
					<li>

						called to be part of the sacred space.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Casting the Circle</b></i> -- the consecration of an area marked out by line or string or rope by a witch or a coven who
						will hold a ritual within it.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Cauldron</b></i> -- a pot, usually with three legs, representing the Goddess.  It is also a tool in various rituals
						sometimes holding water, sometimes fire.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Censer</b></i> -- a container of some sort in which incense is burned.  Also known as a <i>thurible</i>, it can be as
						simple as a can of sand or as elaborate as a fancy metal device suspended and swung on delicate chains.  It symbolizes the
						element of air in some rituals.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Centering</b></i> -- the process a witch uses to prepare herself for a ritual or other Wiccan activity such as meditating.
						Also known as <i>grounding</i>, the idea is to clear away all negative energy or distracting thoughts by directing your focus
						and awareness inwardly.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Chakra</b></i> -- the word itself is from the Sanskrit language and means wheel.  It refers to a round, spinning, disc-like
						area of power within the body.  There are seven such areas located along the spine from the tailbone to the top of the head. They
						allow energy to enter into and flow from the body/aura. By focusing the will on these centers in particular orders, power is
						raised which aids the witch in working magick.  This concept is also associated with Taoists, Hindus, Hopis and Tibetans.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Chalice</b></i> -- a drinking vessel or goblet consisting usually of bowl, stem and base and without handles.  It is used
						for drinking as in the ritual of <i>Cakes and Ale</i>.  It can also be used in other rituals and typically represents the element
						of water.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Chant</b></i> -- a series of words repeated in a rhythmic way.  A witch employs a chant to focus her will and build energy
						toward working magick to achieve a goal.  Chanting can also cause an altered state of consciousness.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Charge</b></i> -- the act of infusing an object with personal energy.  This magick enables the object to serve in subsequent
						rituals.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Charm</b></i> -- Either a spoken spell or incantation <i>or</i> another name for an amulet or talisman.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Cingulum</b></i> -- a knotted cord usually worn with ritual robes. The length and color of the cord can denote degrees of
						achievement or advancement <i>or</i> an association with a certain coven.  Besides being decorative it can also be functional by
						the charging the knots with energy to be released at a later time and place.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Circle</b></i> -- the sacred, consecrated place a witch marks out in order to then perform a ritual or magick.  Size can
						vary as well as material.  The line of the circle might be a rope or a grain mixture or just a line in the dirt.  The circle is
						primarily to provide a safe and suitable place for the witch to work.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Cone of power</b></i> -- the circle a witch has described for her ritual forms the base of a cone in which the energy raised
						by the witch is contained and then directed to achieve her goal.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Consecrate</b></i> -- to make suitable (i.e., purified and holy) for magickal purposes.  All tools used in rituals and
						working magick should be consecrated. This is typically done by applying salted (holy) water to the object and passing it through
						censer smoke.  Special oils are also used.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Coven</b></i> -- a group of witches who meet together regularly to practice their religion. There is usually a High Priest
						or Priestess (perhaps both) who leads them and keeps the group’s <i>Book of Shadows</i>.  Historically, covens were said to
						consist of thirteen witches whose meetings coincided with the full moon.  They usually share a common tradition (e.g.,
						Gardnerian, Seax-Wicca, Hereditary, etc.).  However, none of this need be absolute.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Crone</b></i> -- one of the aspects of the Goddess.  The crone is the third and eldest. Older Wiccan women are so called as
						a way of recognizing their wisdom.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Curse</b></i> -- an appeal to the supernatural powers to cause harm or injury to someone else.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Dedication</b></i> -- a ritual or ceremony, formal or informal, in which a witch consecrates himself or herself to the
						practice of the Craft and the worship of the Goddess.  Can be done in the context of a coven or by a solitary practitioner.  Also
						known as the <i>initiation</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>De-magicking</b></i> -- the process of returning magickal energies back to the earth.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Deosil</b></i> -- a clockwise motion.  This usually refers to one of the ways a witch moves about a circle during a ritual.
						Clockwise is much more common than counterclockwise because <i>deosil</i> movement is the natural path and thus is thought to
						generate positive energy.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Drawing down the moon</b></i> -- a major ritual usually performed at the full moon in which a witch invokes the Goddess to
						charge her with divine energy.  If performed by a coven, the High Priestess seeks for the Goddess to descend, fill her and speak
						through her to the other witches.
					</li>
					<li>
						Eclectic -- the practice of picking and choosing among the many Wiccan traditions for the rites, tools and teachings that suit a
						witch or a coven best.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Elements</b></i> -- the four basic elements are air, earth, fire and water.  These represent the four classes of energy that
						are the building blocks of the universe. Everything that exists contains at least one of these types of energy. Spirit is sometimes
						seen to be a fifth element which acts as a binder.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Elementals</b></i> -- a spirit or entity typically associated with one of the four elements. Those associated with air are
						known as <i>sylphs</i>; those with earth are <i>gnomes</i>; <i>salamanders</i> are associated with fire; while water elementals
						are called <i>undines</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Elixir</b></i> -- a type of potion typically associated with and used to improve or restore health and energy.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Energy</b></i> -- the basis of magick.  It is the power that can be raised, channeled and directed through rituals,
						incantations and other means.  All living things and the earth itself have inert energy available to be tapped.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Equinox</b></i> -- the word means "<i>equal night</i>". Twice a year during the spring and autumn, the duration of daylight
						and darkness are the same.  These are traditional times of celebration for Wiccans.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Esbat</b></i> -- typically the monthly meeting and ritual of the full moon.  However some use the term to refer to any
						meeting of  witches other than Sabbats.  In these meetings witchcraft "work" is done while Sabbats are celebrations.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Evocation</b></i>--  the summoning of a spirit or entity to appear or attend either visibly or invisibly.  In this practice,
						the spirit is maintained externally or outside the witch’s circle of protection, not invited to enter her body.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Fetish</b></i> -- an object believed to possess a specific magickal power or ability.  The object is used in some way
						(carried, buried, burned, etc.) to make use of or to release the power.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Fire festivals</b></i> -- four celebrations closely associated with planting, harvesting and hunting.  The four are
						<i>Beltane, Samhain, Imbolc,</i> and <i>Lamas</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Goddess Mother</b></i> -- a Wiccan godmother.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Green Man</b></i> -- an image of the God (the male) aspect of divinity which is closely connected to nature.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Grimoire</b></i> -- the "recipe" book for spells, charms, etc.  It is the step by step manual for how to work magic.  Often
						a section in a witch’s <i>Book of Shadows</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Grounding</b></i> -- for some the same as <i>centering</i>.  More commonly it is the process of a witch reinforcing her
						connection to the earth after performing magick for the purpose of dispersing any unused residue of energy.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Handfasting</b></i> -- the Wiccan marriage ceremony.  It formally joins two people (genders can be flexible) in the name of
						the Goddess and God. There are different versions.  Some unions are set for a specific and predetermined amount of time but most
						are for "<i>so long as love shall last</i>".  Can be legally recognized though most are probably done without civil sanction.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Handparting</b></i> -- the Wiccan divorce procedure.  When love no longer prevails between the couple as such they may be
						formally parted through this ritual.  Again there are various versions of the ceremony.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Hex(ing)</b></i> -- derived from the German word for <i>witch</i> and refers to the casting of a spell which usually is meant
						for harm.  Synonymous with a <i>curse</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>High Priest(ess)</b></i> -- the leader of a coven of witches.  Usually these individuals are more advanced in their experience
						and knowledge of the Craft.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Imbolc</b></i> -- one of the Greater Sabbats celebrated on February 1 which marks the recovery of the Goddess from giving
						birth to the sun (the God) at Yule. The festival celebrates the first stirrings of spring and specifically that some animals are
						beginning the cycle of life again.  Sheep, for example, are usually carrying young at this time (the word means "<i>in the
						belly</i>"). Also known as Candlemas, Lupercalia and the Feast of Pan.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Incantation</b></i> -- a chant or rhyme used to help gather, channel and direct the power or energy used for magick.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Incense</b></i> -- an aromatic herb, spice, gum or a blend of such in either a powder, cone or stick form that is burned
						during rituals.  Burning incense adds to the ambience of a ritual and in turn stimulates the centering and focus of the witch as
						she does magick.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Infusion</b></i> -- basically a tea of some sort.  It is the process of steeping herbs or other plants in hot water to create
						a brew.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Invocation</b></i> -- a ritual process whereby the witch appeals to and invites a spirit, an entity or a deity to appear and
						enter into her or some other person or object. The goal is to have that being merge with and to some degree control the person in
						such a way as to be able to have the being speak or perform some other desired action.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Lady</b></i> -- a common reference to the Goddess who is revealed in the three aspects of Maiden, Mother and Crone which
						represent the three stages of life.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Lammas</b></i> -- one of the four Greater Sabbats falling on August 1.  Also known as Lughnasadh, Festival of Light or
						August Eve, it marks the halfway point between Summer Solstice and the Fall Equinox.  It is the first of the harvest festivals.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Law of Three</b></i> -- also known as the Law of Attraction or Law of Return (among other variations).  Much like the idea
						of <i>karma</i>, this is the Wiccan belief that whatever energy or action one sends out will return to her threefold.  Thus Wiccans
						contend they have much incentive to work for good and no reason to seek to do harm.  Though recognized by most Wiccans as a primary
						rule for the Craft some reject it as having overtones of morality.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Left-hand path</b></i> -- black magick used to manipulate the free will of another or cause harm.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Libation</b></i> -- a liquid offering to the Goddess and God.  It is traditional for those imbibing wine or other beverage
						during a ritual or celebration to spill a little on the ground first to honor whatever gods are being recognized.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Litha</b></i> -- also known as Midsummer or Summer Solstice.  It is one of the Lesser Sabbats occurring on or around June 21.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Lord</b></i> -- a common reference to the God who represents the masculine aspect of the All.  He is both the son of the
						Lady and also her consort.  While she is seen in the moon, he is seen in the sun.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Mabon</b></i> -- a Lesser Sabbat celebrated on or around September 21 which is the Autumn or Fall Equinox.  This is the
						second harvest festival.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Maiden</b></i> -- The youngest aspect of the Goddess.  In a Wiccan coven it can also refer to a skilled witch who assists
						the High Priest or Priestess.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Mana</b></i> -- a Melanesian or Polynesian term which refers to the universal life force. The Sanskrit word is <i>prana</i>
						while the Chinese call it <i>Chi</i> and the Japanese say <i>Ki</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Ostara</b></i> -- the Lesser Sabbat celebrated on or around March 21, the Spring Equinox.  It marks the return of the sun
						(the God) and the fertility of the earth (the Goddess).  Also known as Estre, Wiccans claim that the word for the Christian
						celebration of Easter is taken from this old festival.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Pagan</b></i> -- from Latin, the word literally means "<i>peasant</i>"  or "<i>country dweller</i>" and refers to those
						involved in religions appealing to the simple human tendencies and old wisdom.  Today it refers mainly to one who is a part of the
						modern revival of religions especially based on nature and magick. The term "<i>neopagan</i>" is used interchangeably.
						<blockquote>
							<b>FYI</b> -- While it is true that all Wiccans would consider themselves to be pagan or neopagan, keep in mind that not all
							pagans consider themselves to be Wiccan.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Pantheon</b></i> -- a collection of deities from one culture, e.g., the Egyptians had their various gods, while the
						Greeks and Romans had another set, while the Scandinavian/Norse/Germanic tribes had yet another group.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Pentacle</b></i> -- an important symbol for Wiccans consisting of a five-pointed star with the single point up (a
						<i>pentagram</i>) within a circle.  The five points of the star refer to the four elements of air, earth, fire and water plus
						spirit which binds them.  The circle is the never ending circle of love.  A witch will usually have a disc of wood, metal, clay
						or some other material with the pentacle inscribed upon it as a working tool of her craft.  It can be used in divination, or as
						part of a ritual as a protective talisman or simply as a tray upon which cakes are placed.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Pentagram</b></i> -- the five pointed interlaced star with the single point up.  The pentagram design goes back to the days
						of ancient Babylon and Wiccans make heavy use of it.  For them it can represent variously the four basic elements plus <i>akasha</i>
						(spirit); or the five senses; or the hand; or the human body.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Poppet</b></i> -- a doll fashioned by a witch out of whatever material she wishes (clay, paper, wax, cloth, straw, etc.) to
						represent a person. The purpose is to help the witch focus on the person while working sympathetic magic on his or her behalf
						(never would it be used for the person’s harm).
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Potion</b></i> -- a liquid produced by combining substances containing magickal properties according to a specific formula
						and method so that the final product can manifest a particular effect.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Power</b></i> -- the life energy (<i>mana</i>) which a witch raises by various means to accomplish her purpose.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Quarters</b></i> -- the four elemental powers and the directions associated with them. East is associated with air; north
						with earth; west with water; and south with fire.  Typically when <i>calling the quarters</i> while making a sacred circle a
						witch will have appropriately colored candles (yellow for air; green for earth; blue for water; red for fire) placed in the
						right positions on her altar to be lit as well as placing symbols of each element next to its respective candle.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Rede</b></i> -- an archaic word meaning "<i>advice</i>" or "counsel".  The Wiccan Rede is an extremely important component
						of the Craft.  It says, "<i>An it harm none, do what thou wilt</i>" meaning simply that as long as you don’t hurt anyone
						(including yourself) you can do what you want.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Reincarnation</b></i> -- the belief that life and death are a continuous cycle.  After dying and spending some amount of
						time in the spirit realm, a person’s soul is sent back into a new physical body for another round of living on earth.  The
						purpose of this is so a person can learn and experience repeatedly until she eventually knows all.  During the intervals in the
						spirit realm the person reviews what was learned in the previous life and makes plans for the life to come.  Some believe that
						sometimes a human may come back as something other than human in a subsequent life.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Retribution</b></i> --  the return for actions taken whether good or bad (see Law of Three). Most Wiccans believe that
						retribution, be it reward or punishment, takes place in this life rather than being "put off" until after death.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Rite</b></i> -- a shorter series of specific actions and/or words which are a part of a larger and more general ritual,
						e.g., the Cakes and Ale rite is a part of every Esbat or Sabbat ritual.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Ritual</b></i> -- a set of rites (actions and words) linked together for either religious or magickal purposes.  These
						rituals are usually intended to induce in the observer an altered state of consciousness conducive to achieving the desired
						results, e.g., <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i>.  In Wicca rituals are almost always performed within the confines of a magic/sacred
						circle.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Rune</b></i>--  alphabets especially used by the ancient Germanic, Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon cultures.  Each letter in
						these old alphabets also had symbolic and magickal meanings.  Seen as mysterious and secret, the use of Runes among Wiccans is
						popular especially in <i>Books of Shadows</i>. Various witches prefer different sets and styles of rune alphabets.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Sabbat</b></i> -- the most important Wiccan holidays.  There are eight spread more or less evenly throughout the year.
						They are considered as Solar holidays marking the annual course of the sun (i.e., the God’s life).  The solstices (<i>Litha</i>
						and <i>Yule</i>) and equinoxes (<i>Ostara</i> and <i>Mabon</i>) are the Lesser Sabbats.  The Greater Sabbats (also called
						Crossquarters) are <i>Imbolc, Beltane,  Lammas,</i> and <i>Samhain</i>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Samhain (sow'-en)</b></i> -- the third and last harvest festival and the most important of the Greater Sabbats.  Falling on
						October 31 it nevertheless marks the beginning of the Wiccan New Year.  Also known as November Eve, Hallowmass, Halloween and
						Feast of Souls, it is seen as a time of reflection about the Wheel of the Year and the cycle of life and a time to honor those
						who have passed on into the otherworld.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Scrying</b></i> -- gazing into or at a reflective surface (e.g. crystal ball) to get knowledge.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Sigil</b></i> -- a sign or symbol which is placed on a object to imbue or convey magickal power to it.  A witch will usually
						inscribe certain symbols to various magick tools (e.g., athame, besom, chalice, etc.) in order to empower them.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Skyclad</b></i> -- an enigmatic term meaning to be without clothes.  Wiccans sometimes perform their rituals "clothed only by
						the sky".  Some Wiccans do this regularly.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Solitary</b></i> -- a witch who chooses to practice and work the Craft alone without the company or help of a coven.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Spell</b></i> -- a series of words (or sounds) and activity of some sort designed and intended to raise, channel and
						direct energy in order to bring about a desired purpose or a change in circumstances.  The word can also refer to a written
						recipe for the performance of such magick (e.g., a spell book).
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Staff</b></i> -- another working tool of the Craft.  Seen as a means of directing power much like a wand.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Summerland</b></i> -- the Wiccan idea of heaven.  It is the astral place where spirits go between incarnations to rest and
						reflect and prepare for their next life.  It is also seen as the abode of the God and Goddess.  Once a soul has learned all it
						can it is able to stay in the Summerland.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Talisman</b></i> -- originating from the Greek teleo meaning "<i>to consecrate</i>" it is an object charged with power so
						as to cause a particular effect on its possessor.  While amulets are usually seen as means of protection, talismans are thought
						of in broader terms and can be made to provide other things (e.g., power, healing, etc.).
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Tradition</b></i> -- one of the many sects or subgroups of Wicca such as Gardnerian, Alexandrian, Dianic, Seax-Wicca, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Visualization</b></i> -- forming mental images for the purpose of better focusing while summoning and sending out the energy
						from a spell or ritual.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Wand</b></i> -- a working tool of the Craft.  Usually a wand or an athame is chosen by a witch as her "personal" tool (the
						one in which she imbues most of her energy and identifies with the most).
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Ward</b></i> -- a magickal field of energy established as a way of safeguarding a person or an area from negative influences.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Wiccaning</b></i> -- the ritual of meeting and blessing a child born into a Wiccan family.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Widdershins</b></i> -- counterclockwise movement opposite of <i>deosil</i> movement.  Used in ritual only when dealing with
						or raising negative energy.
					</li>
					<li>
						<i><b>Witch</b></i> -- one who seeks to manipulate the universal energies through ritual and the elements of nature to live well
						and at peace.  From the Anglo-Saxon word "<i>wicce</i>" which means "wise one".

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bases of Wiccan Beliefs</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have covered a decent bit of ground thus far in our study and have recognized that
				Wicca is an increasingly prominent religion, studied its beginnings and development, and have looked at its terms. But we have yet to
				give a clear, concise explanation of the truths it embraces.  Though we have noted that nailing down an exact definition is difficult
				due to the great diversity among followers of the Craft, here are a few ideas offered by Wiccan writers:
				<blockquote>
					<i>These days, Wicca refers to a set of practices, beliefs and traditions associated with people  who call themselves witches.</i>
					(Anne-Marie Gallagher, <i>The Wicca Bible</i>, p. 16 cited by Ankerberg and Burroughs, <i>What’s the Big Deal about Other Religions</i>,
					p. 110.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>What exactly is Wicca?  For now, let’s just say that Wicca is an earth-based or nature-based religion founded on ancient beliefs</i>.
					(Zimmerman and Gleason, <i>The Complete Idiot’s Guide to  Wicca and Witchcraft</i>, p.4 cited by Ankerberg and Burroughs, p. 110.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>[Wicca is]a loosely organized Pagan religion centering around reverence for the creative forces of Nature, usually symbolized by a
					goddess and a god.</i> (Scott Cunningham, Wicca: <i>A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner</i>, p.xiv cited by Burroughs and Alupoaicei,
					<i>Generation Hex</i>, p. 32).
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From these definitions we can see three general principles about Wicca which have already
				been mentioned or inferred in the study:
				<ol>
					<li>
						The Wiccan worldview draws on old ideas from many other genuinely ancient religions.
					</li>
					<li>
						These ideas are "pagan", that is, having to do with folk wisdom and lore which naturally arises from interaction with the earth
						in early agrarian cultures.  Thus Wicca is primarily oriented to the processes of nature and the seasonal and cosmic cycles.
					</li>
					<li>
						The methods employed in the attempt to raise and manipulate the energy and power attributed to nature and the cosmos are
						generally referred to as "<i>working magick</i>" or "<i>witchcraft</i>".  Thus Wicca is closely connected with the idea of
						witches and witchcraft.
					</li>
				</ol>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As noted, these three basic characteristics of Wicca are no doubt redundant to the
				reader by this time (at least I hope so!).  But now let’s delve a little deeper and see how Wiccans (at least many of them) view the
				nature of reality.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wiccans generally think of the universe in <b>monistic</b> terms, or in other words,
			<i>all is one and one is all</i>.  The idea is that everything in reality is interconnected to such an extent that there is no real difference
			between dirt, rocks, trees, insects, animals, humans or God -- they all possess the essence of the universe.  Problems arise, not because
			of sin or evil, but rather because of ignorance of this interconnectedness and the subsequent failure to relate correctly to the other parts
			of reality.  This philosophy is largely Eastern in origin (e.g., Buddhism).
			<blockquote>
				<b>FYI</b> -- Of course, since humans are the only beings in this reality who can make conscious choices about <i>how</i> to relate to
				the rest of the universe it stands to reason that <i>w</i>e are the problem (at least those of us who refuse to get with the tree-hugging
				program).  This "humans are the problem" idea is a key proposition of the radical environmentalist agenda.
			</blockquote>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This monistic viewpoint is ultimately reflected in a belief that there is but one true
				creative force or energy in the universe which is fittingly referred to as "<i>The One</i>" or "<i>The All</i>".  Consider the following
				quotes:
				<blockquote>
					<i>I think of the gods as expressions of the divine life force that creates all things</i>.” (Christopher Penczak, <i>Sons of the
					Goddess</i>, p. 16.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>One of the most beautiful and enduring truths about practicing Wicca is that this is a nature-based religion that encourages you to
					connect in an active and positive way with the divine energy of the source of creation: the All.</i> (Liguana and Metzner, <i>The Complete
					Idiot’s Guide  to Wicca Craft</i>,  p. xviiii.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems that most Wiccans would say this force or energy is impersonal (e.g., <i>Star
				Wars</i>) if for no other reason than its sheer vastness.  It is a natural or elemental phenomenon in which all things participate and
				from which all things arise.  This leads us to another foundational philosophy for Wicca, namely, <b>pantheism</b> or <i>God is everything
				and everything is God</i>.  In other words, not only are all things equal in importance but they are also each possess the divine attribute
				of spirit (<i>akasha</i>) which binds all things together.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- Pantheism is not exclusive to Wicca (e.g., it is also prevalent in New Age thinking) but it, hand in hand with monism,
					explains why Wiccans can:
					<ol>
						<li>
							focus so much on the creation in their worship and;
						</li>
						<li>
							deny that there is a need for a Savior’s atonement and human repentance since we are all part of the same substance and spirit.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, as one might surmise, it is not satisfying for most human beings to worship
				impersonal things like a force or a cosmic energy.  Wiccans are certainly no exception.  Burroughs and Alupoaicei comment,
				<blockquote>
					<i>Like many of us, Wiccans believe that their hearts and souls have been starved by technology and the lack of meaningful relationships
					with God, other people, and nature.  Many people turn to Wicca because they long for a faith that feels real and tangible.  Often
					they’re seeking a powerful spiritual and emotional experience ...</i>  (<i>Generation Hex</i>, p. 39)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So it is that Wiccans believe the All has two equal and opposite sides represented by
				male and female aspects.  This in turn makes the objects of their worship more approachable.  Listen as Christopher Penczak continues,
				<blockquote>
					This life force, or Great Spirit, has a female, or Goddess, side, and a male, or God, side.  I think the Goddess has many different
					faces, many different masks. ... The masks and names make it easier to see her.  The Goddess, in her entirety, is just too vast to
					understand, but if you only look at one part of her, she becomes knowable and more human. (<i>Sons of the Goddess</i>, p. 16.)
				</blockquote>
				Burroughs and Alupoaicei quote Wiccan author Scott Cunningham who writes,
				<blockquote>
					Wicca ... recognizes Deity as dual.  It reveres both the Goddess and the God.  They are equal, warm and loving, not distant or
					resident in ‘heaven’ but omnipresent throughout the universe.” (<i>Generation Hex</i>, p. 61).
				</blockquote>
				Thus Wiccans can have a real and fulfilling interaction with these beings who are the personifications of the All.  Later we’ll explore
				a little closer some of Wicca’s specific teachings about the origins and relationship of the God and Goddess but for now let’s consider
				two more underlying philosophies enmeshed with this idea.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first one is dualism, the idea that <i>everything existing has an equal opposite</i>.
				Prominent in Wiccan thinking is the idea that reality is (or should be) perfectly balanced.  As seen in the above quotation from Scott
				Cunningham this is an obvious implication from the alleged nature of the God and the Goddess.  On page 18 of his book <i>Sons of the
				Goddess: A Young Man’s Guide to Wicca</i>, Christopher Penczak offers a sidebar explaining this concept further:
				<blockquote>
					<i>When witches think about the Goddess and God in their most primal forms, they are seen as the polar energies that create the universe.
					They are not opposing forces but complements, like a battery or magnet.  To work properly, it needs a positive and negative end.</i>
				</blockquote>
				Then on a chart he  associates with the God the following attributes: "<i>Male, Sky, Sun, Light, Day,  Projecting, Yang, Mental, Air and
				fire</i>" while the Goddess possesses the opposite qualities "<i>Female, Earth, Moon, Dark, Night, Receiving, Yin, Emotional, Earth and
				water</i>".  Achieving balance is seen as extremely valuable to most adherents of Wicca.  Once again this philosophy has its known
				beginnings in the Far East (e.g., the <i>Yin-Yang</i> of Taoism).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second plainly seen doctrine connected with the Goddess and God is the concept of
				<b>polytheism</b>, or the <i>recognition and worship of many gods</i>.  Wiccans generally go in one of a couple of directions in this
				respect.  Most seem to believe that the Goddess and God are simply who they are and refer to them as the Lord and Lady, or as the Great
				Mother and the Horned God, or as Gaia and the Green Man (among other names).  But also they have been known throughout the world in
				different cultures by different names (e.g., Jupiter, Thor, Ra, Pan, etc. for the God and Diana, Brigid, Isis, Artemis, etc. for the
				Goddess).  The names do not matter for they are only labels all applying to the same two beings.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second approach allows for even more gods and demi-gods. Some, a minority it seems,
				think of the various pantheons of gods and goddesses (e.g. Greek, Norse Egyptian, etc.) as underlings of sorts who can be called upon by
				Wiccans to carry their prayers to the ruling God and Goddess.  In discussing this matter on p. 63 of <i>Generation Hex</i>, Marla Alupoaicei
				compared it to Roman Catholics who pray to Mary and the saints asking them to intercede with God the Father on their behalf. We’ll talk
				about the elementals and other beings later.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- It is also worth noting at this point that some (perhaps many) Wiccans do not believe that the God and Goddess are
					actual, literal, personal beings but only symbols which merely represent the aforementioned balance and comprehensiveness of the
					cosmic force of nature.  To them, what is being recognized in their religion is simply the true nature of reality and becoming one
					with it so as to achieve peace and personal balance.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To conclude, I want to excerpt p. 62 of <i>Generation Hex</i> where the authors give a
				good summary of what we have covered in this section:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Wiccan teachings propose a Goddess and a God that exist together, possess equal power, have both a ‘light’ (good) and a ‘dark’ (evil)
					side, and express themselves in a variety of ways through nature.  Wiccans also call the God and the Goddess ‘ the One,’ ‘the Lord
					and Lady’ or ‘the All.’  Wiccans believe that the Deity is immanent (able to be experienced or known) and transcendent.  They also
					believe that every living entity has a spirit that is connected to and part of every other spirit, and that humans are part of
					nature.  In addition, Wiccans believe that divinity manifests itself through all living beings and that the God and Goddess exist
					as aspects of a greater divinity.  Wicca centers on the protection and worship of the God, Goddess, and nature.  Because most of
					nature is divided into male and female genders, the deities also are male and female.  Wiccans’ worship of these ‘twin’ or
					‘complementary’ deities reflects the dichotomies and cycles of nature: day and night, summer and winter, planting and harvest, birth
					and death, and so on.</i>

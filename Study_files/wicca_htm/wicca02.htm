			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>History:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already mentioned that there is no consensus regarding the true history of
				Wicca.  But that doesn’t mean it’s a total mystery.  A.J. Drew, in his book <i>Wicca for Couples</i>, asserts that
				<blockquote>
					<i>all Wiccans seem to agree ... that our religion is either based on ancient Pagan fertility religions or is itself a descendant of
					those same religions.</i> (p. 32.)
				</blockquote>
				Thus what we are dealing with is either:
				<ol>
					<li>
						old ideas mixed with some contemporary thinking and a bit of modern marketing and, voila!, a new religion; or
					</li>
					<li>
						some of these old religions actually survived over the centuries being passed down from generation to generation until the
						time was right for it to re-emerge.
					</li>
				</ol>
				Which is right?  Steve Russo poses and answers a question:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Does it sound confusing that Wicca can be both contemporary and centuries old?  Here’s a brief explanation: Wicca’s core beliefs
					are the same today as they were centuries ago, only now they’ve been repackaged for the twenty-first century with a contemporary
					look and feel.</i> (<i>What’s the Deal with Wicca?</i>, pp.18-19.)
				</blockquote>
				Is he correct?  Let’s see.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Ancient Roots</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is certainly some truth in the assumption that the roots of Wicca are pagan.
				Both the Bible and secular history record ancient and primitive cultures whose religious activity centered around the worship of
				fertility gods and goddesses whether Baal and Asherah of the Canaanites, or Woden and Freya of the Norse and Germanic cultures, or
				Pan and Diana of the Greeks or countless others.  These ideas and practices have been around for millennia.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For some (e.g., Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner -- more on them later) modern
				Wicca is a direct descendant of these ancient religions.  We do not have space for a thorough examination so a general summary must
				suffice.   According to those who hold to this view of Wiccan origins, the ancient cultures understood that there was a supreme deity
				but could not grasp enough to fully comprehend how to worship Him/Her/It.  Instead they worshipped the localized sub-gods (such as
				those already referenced).  Typically there was a god of the hunt and a goddess of fertility.  This continued to evolve and develop
				over time.  Since modern Wicca is largely from the United Kingdom there is a special interest in referencing the Celts and druids and
				their beliefs and practices (secretive, nature loving, moon and sun oriented, etc.) as primary ancestors of the Craft.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- Wikipedia cites a Professor Ronald Hutton as declaring that Wicca is "<i>the only religion England has ever given the
					world</i>:,   (Wow ... thanks a lot, old chaps!)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, when we speak of such things as this we’re talking about developments taking
				place over two or three thousand years ago while modern Wicca did not really re-emerge until the 1950’s.  Why did it take so long and
				what happened to the followers of the "<i>Old religion</i>" during those years?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again according to some Wiccans, several events caused this ancient and mysterious
			religion to have to go underground.  The three waves of invasions by first the Romans, later the Saxons and finally the Normans into the
			English isles caused folks like the druids, pagans and witches to hide their beliefs or else be persecuted
			<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org">(History of Wicca}</a>. That last invasion by the Normans took place late in the eleventh century
			around 1066 AD.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the most damaging attacks came from Christianity.  As Christianity became dominant
				in the Roman empire and later as the office of the Pope became more influential as the empire broke into city states and nations, the
				hostility against paganism was strong.  In 1401 the English parliament passed the first laws against witchcraft which were harsh and
				became even harsher as time went on (Russo, <i>What’s the Deal with Wicca?</i>, p. 27). In 1484 Pope Innocent VII also encouraged
				people to be on the lookout for witches and in response someone printed <i>The Witches Hammer</i>, a manual to help those hunting
				witches (Ibid).  Wiccans refer to these years (ca. 1450-1790) as the "<i>Burning Times</i>" because that’s what happened to many who
				were convicted of being witches <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org">(History of Wicca)</a>.  It is estimated by some that across
				Europe and in the American colonies between 40,000 and 100,000 people were executed for the crime of witchcraft during this period
				<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org">(History of Wicca)</a>.  Those who subscribe to this view assert that it was during these
				years that the "<i>Old religion</i>" was almost destroyed, its followers nearly exterminated and much of the writings and lore
				lost.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It only barely survived by once again going deep underground as it did during the
				aforementioned invasions.  Practitioners most often performed their rites and ceremonies alone or in very small groups.  Most of the
				information and practice that remained was passed down in the family from one generation to another.  Thus the forbearers of what we
				know today as Wicca persevered but their religion was not in any way influential or even known about until the last fifty years or
				so.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Modern Revival</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whether all the preceding information is accurate or not, the contemporary movement
				of Wicca is quite real and quite traceable in its development.  By far the most often cited name with regard to Wicca’s current
				manifestation is that of Gerald Gardner.   By all accounts, he was an English civil servant and amateur archaeologist/anthropologist
				who spent many years in the Far East and was fascinated with some of the mystery religions there.  Some might say his interest came
				naturally for, according to William C. Viser, an ancestor, Grissell Gardner, was burned at the stake for practicing witchcraft in
				1610 (<i>The Darkness Among Us</i>, p. 124).  He studied and engaged in several Eastern mystical sects and by the time he returned to
				England was an "<i>avid occultist</i>" <a href="http://www.contenderministries.org/wicca/history.php">(History and Background of
				Wicca)</a>.  In 1939, he joined a group known now as the <i>New Forest coven</i>, a group of witches practicing in Dorset, England.
				In 1952 the last of the anti-Witchcraft laws were repealed and this freed Gardner to begin promoting his faith.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- The last person convicted under the Witchcraft Act in England was Helen Duncan in 1944.  She allegedly had powers
					of clairvoyancy (knowing what is not in normal range of sight or hearing) and authorities feared she might betray plans for the
					Normandy invasion to German agents.  She spent nine months in prison.  (Russo, p. 28.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gardner always claimed that the coven he joined had been in continual existence
				over the centuries and thus had descended from ancient times intact except for a lack of written material regarding their practices.
				His concern was that the movement was dying out and he wanted to help revive it.  In this attempt Gardner helped establish other
				covens (one of note was the <i>Bricket Wood coven</i>) and wrote several books with <i>Witchcraft Today</i> in 1954 and <i>The
				Meaning of Witchcraft</i> in 1959 being perhaps the two most influential.  He is also credited with creating the first <i>Book of
				Shadows</i> (a workbook describing rituals, spells, etc.) around 1953 though some suggest he plagiarized some or much of it from
				other sources.  Over the course of the years he interacted with several other notable occultists/witches such as Aleister Crowley,
				Doreen Valiente and Raymond Buckland.  Toward the end of his life he served as "resident witch" at the <i>Museum of Magic and
				Witch-craft</i> in Castletown on the Isle of Man (Viser, p. 124).  He died in 1964.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other notables who came forward in the 1950s claiming to be members of old line
				covens which were surviving remnants of the ancient faith include Sybil Leek, Charles Cardell, Raymond Howard, Rolla Nordic and Robert
				Cochrane (Wikipedia).  One who was initially influential in presenting and defending the idea that Wicca is the direct descendant of
				an old pre-Christian pagan faith was Margaret Murray.  She wrote <i>The Witch Cult in Western Europe</i> and <i>The God of the
				Witches</i> both of which dealt with that premise <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org">(History of Wicca)</a>.  But these others
				had little or nothing to do with Gardner.  It is important to note that many of these others (who claimed to be of the "<i>Hereditary</i>"
				or "<i>Traditional</i>" forms of witchcraft) were often at odds with what came to be known as the "<i>Gardnerian</i>" form.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much of the dispute seems to stem from differences in opinion about who had the best
				or most valid pedigree.  An example of this conflict can be had concerning the man thought to be most responsible for introducing Wicca
				into the United States.  Raymond Buckland, along with his wife Rosemary, moved to Long Island, New York from England in the early 1960’s.
				In their travels back and forth from the USA to the UK, they corresponded with and were influenced by Gerald Gardner. Finally they were
				initiated into the "Gardnerian" form of the Craft.  Upon returning to New York they founded the Long Island coven (wikipedia.org).
				Buckland was very outspoken and many others practicing Wicca found him to be arrogant.  A.J. Drew comments,
				<blockquote>
					<i>Some publications of the late 1960s and early 1970s indicate that in the eyes of many Hereditary Witches already practicing in the
					United States, Buckland seemingly declared himself the Pope of all Witches.  You can see how this would cause a divide between the
					invading Gardnerian Wicca and the Hereditary Witches already in the United States who had no connection to Mr. Gardner much less
					Mr. Buckland.</i>  (<i>Wicca for Couples</i>, p. 42.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- In his book, Mr. Drew continues discussing this conflict and refers to it as the <i>Witch War</i>.  Though it mostly
					consisted of public disdain and verbal attacks directed at one another, sometimes it escalated to the point of competing witches
					or covens working destructive spells and negative magic against each other.  (Oooooh...scary.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But regardless of one’s opinion of Buckland it cannot be denied that he was extremely
				able in his promotion of Wicca.  He wrote several influential books, among them <i>Witchcraft -- Ancient and Modern</i>, <i>Witchcraft From
				the Inside</i>, Buckland’s <i>Complete Book of Witchcraft</i> and <i>The Tree: The Complete Book of Saxon Witchcraft</i> (Ankerberg and
				Burroughs, <i>What’s the Big Deal About Other Religions</i>, p. 111).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In these years Wiccan thought and practice went in many different directions.  Others
				who founded or heavily influenced various Wiccan groups include Alexander Sanders (<i>Alexandrian Wicca</i>); Mary Nesnick (<i>Algardian
				Wicca</i> -- an attempt to meld the Gardnerian and Alexandrian forms); Zsuzsanna Budapest (<i>Dianic</i> Wicca -- heavily emphasizes
				feminism); a practitioner called ‘Starhawk’  tried to reconcile the <i>Gardnerian</i> and <i>Dianic</i> traditions in her book <i>Spiral
				Dance</i>; and Steward and Janet Farrar who eventually left the <i>Alexandrian</i> form and decided to unveil Wicca completely to the
				public by publishing works such as <i>Eight Sabbats for Witches</i> (1981) and <i>The Witches’ Way</i> (1984).  To show just how fluid
				Wicca is in general we should note that Buckland, after spending so much effort establishing the Gardnerian form in the USA, decided to
				leave it in 1973 and create a new sort which he called <i>Seax-Wicca</i>, which almost exclusively emphasizes the Saxon traditions.
				There are many other notable names among Wiccans such as Paul Huson, Jessie Wicker Bell (aka ‘Lady Sheba,’ self-styled ‘Queen of American
				Witches’), Silver Ravenwolf and Isaac Bonewits.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>True Origins?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One last major point needs to be made before we leave off exploring the history of Wicca.
				In more recent years many Wiccans have concluded that the idea that the religion they practice is directly descended from an ancient religion
				through a <i>continuous</i> line is just so much hogwash.  Those who take this position are critical of the scholarship of people like Gerald
				Gardner and Margaret Murray.  Wikipedia cites Wiccan Jenny Gibbon who writes:
				<blockquote>
					<i>We Neopagans now face a crisis.  As new data appeared, historians altered their theories to account for it.  We have not.  Therefore
					an enormous gap has opened between the academic and the ‘average’ Pagan view of witchcraft.  We continue to use outdated and poor
					writers, like Margaret Murray, Montague Summers, Gerald Gardner, and Jules Michelet.  We avoid the somewhat dull academic texts that
					present solid research, preferring sensational writers who play to our emotions.</i>
				</blockquote>
				 Likewise, the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance website cites Joanna Hautin-Mayer who comments:
				 <blockquote>
				 	<i>We know tragically little about the actual religious expressions of the ancient Celts.  We have a few myths and legends, but very
					little archaeological evidence to support our theories.  We have no written records of their actual forms of worship, and the
					accounts of their culture and beliefs written by their contemporaries are often highly biased and of questionable historical
					worth.</i> <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org">(History of Wicca)</a>
				</blockquote>
				The website goes on to note that Ms. Hautin-Mayer is extremely critical of works which propose the theory of a continuous existence of
				this kind of pagan religion which eventually became modern Wicca.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of those who reject the ‘ancient origins’ theory also question the motives and
				integrity of Gardner.  For instance, A.J. Drew, in discussing the origins of the Witch War,  points out how Gardner conveniently neglected
				to disclose the whole truth regarding the repealing of the Witchcraft Act:
				<blockquote>
					<i>When Mr. Gardner told us that it was only the English repeal of anti-Witchcraft laws in 1952 that allowed him and others to come
					forward, he forgot to mention that those remaining laws dealt primarily with fraud and not with religion.  Other than those laws
					designed to protect an innocent public from fraudulent fortune tellers, the anti-Witchcraft laws had been abolished since 1736.</i>
					(<i>Wicca for Couples</i>, p. 44.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- Indeed, Russo remarks that in 1736, with King George II on the throne, Parliament changed the tone of the Witchcraft
					Act so that instead of convicted perpetrators being guilty of a capital offense they were rather treated as con artists for which
					the penalty was a fine or imprisonment (<i>What’s the Deal with Wicca?</i>, p. 28).  So Gardner was not in mortal danger because of
					his choice of faith as is implied in his and others’ writings.
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus many Wiccans have been forced to the conclusion that Gardner and some of the others
				did not actually uncover an ancient religion that had been concealed for centuries because of persecution, but rather he and they created
				it.  A.J. Drew continues:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The religion that would change my life was invented only a decade before my birth and was sterilized when I was too young to know what
					sterility was.  Yes, I did say invented.  Although Mr. Gardner filled our culture with the belief that Wicca had been hiding from
					religious persecution between the beginnings of the Burning Times and England’s repeal of the final Witchcraft laws in 1952, the
					truth had become clear to all but our most novice.</i> (<i>Wicca for Couples</i>, p. 43.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of my sources agree with A.J. Drew that the vast majority of Wiccans understand that
				the "<i>Old Religion</i>" they practice is actually a fairly new phenomenon.  They also agree, as we earlier asserted, that it does contain
				many elements which have been in existence for millennia.  But these elements have come from many diverse sources.  Thus modern <i>Wicca</i>
				is an amalgamation of teachings and practices from such things as Celtic and druidic legends, Gnosticism and Freemasonry, the occult and
				spiritism (remember Gardner’s association with Aleister Crowley?), Eastern mysticism and religions (such as Hinduism), shamanism and Native
				American religions, New Age philosophies and even science fiction.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You might think that the knowledge of this discrepancy between what the founding leaders
				claimed and the actual truth might throw up a red flag to one considering the Craft as an option for his or her worldview and life.  That
				the openly acknowledged deception and/or ignorance might impede one’s interest in Wicca.  That assumption would be incorrect.  A typical
				attitude is likely reflected in the words of Wiccan author Silver Ravenwolf:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Wicca, as you practice the religion today, is a new religion, barely fifty years old.  The techniques you use at present are not
					entirely what your elders practiced even thirty years ago.  Of course, threads of ‘what was’ weave through the tapestry of ‘what is
					now’ ... in no way can we replicate to perfection the precise circumstances of environment, society, culture, religion and magick a
					hundred years ago, or a thousand.  Why would we want to?  The idea is to go forward with the knowledge of the past, tempered by the
					tools of our own age.</i> (cited in <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org">History of Wicca</a>)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus Wicca does have ancient elements of various movements and ideas.  These attributes
				are old because they are all typical of the common characteristic human kind has manifested since the beginning no matter what the label
				may be.  That characteristic is, namely, our sinful rebellion reflected in the attempt to create our own god and make our own rules and
				do our own thing.  So Wicca is old in that it is simply another version of belief in the original lie from Satan (i.e., that we can be
				like God) and it is new in that this particular religion has its own flavor and teachings.  Let’s see what some of those ideas are and
				how they are implemented.</font></p>

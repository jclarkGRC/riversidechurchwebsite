			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Falling Into Wicca:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that we have looked at some of the philosophical and theological foundations of
				Wiccan thought we will next look at some of the rules and principles which they hold dear.  In other words the things they believe and
				practice in everyday life.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Early learning</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When a person decides to give Wicca a try (we will look a little later at the question
				of <i>why</i> they might make this choice when we attempt to better understand how best to reach out to witches with the Gospel) he or
				she will naturally try to learn more about it.  There are many avenues to gaining such knowledge. Books (such as those referenced in
				this study) are easily found in the major bookstore chains as the growth of Wicca has created a huge demand.  Websites are also a popular
				place to find out about the Craft with the most visited probably being <i>wicca.com</i> and <i>witchvox.com</i>.  There is also formal
				training available online at <i>WitchSchool.com</i>.  Or there may be a more personal connection, for instance, the person may know a
				witch with advanced knowledge who is willing to mentor him or her one-on-one.   Or the person may find and join a coven in order to be
				trained by them.  It is not hard to find out more about Wicca these days and, as we noted in the introduction, more and more are doing so.
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- According to Burroughs and Alupoaicei, <i>WitchSchool</i> has 300 instructors, more than 130,000 registered students
					and every online tool used by the major universities.  (<i>Generation Hex</i>, p. 13)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The first steps</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whatever the case may be, after doing enough research and making the decision to become
				a witch, one of the first things the person will probably do is be <i>dedicated</i> (or <i>initiated</i>) into the Craft.  In some cases
				they are being initiated into a particular tradition (or branch) of Wicca.  If this is so, it will probably be a group thing with certain
				prescribed procedures in the ritual marking them as Gardnerian or Alexandrian or Dianic and so on.  Or it could be a coven of
				<i>eclectic</i> (independent) witches who will have made up their own ceremony.   Or it could be that the person wishes to be a solitary
				practitioner and thus she is dedicating herself.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Miria  Liguana and Nina Metzner share a simple form (their main goal seems to be to
				encourage beginners by making things very easy) of the ritual in their book <i>The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Wicca Craft</i>.  First they
				encourage the reader to pick a day when she is in a good frame of mind and then choose a private place and a quiet moment so she will be
				undisturbed.  They tell the reader to at least take off her shoes (if not comfortable working skyclad) and create a sacred space by
				casting a magick circle using her athame and by using candles, holy water or a few other options.  After everything is set:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Spend a few moments touching base with your own feelings.  Sprinkle your sacred space with holy water.  Take several deep breaths.
					Listen to the sounds around you.  Once you’re sure you are in touch with yourself and aware of your surroundings, kneel down on your
					left knee.  Put your right hand under your right heel and your left hand on your head.  Then, say out loud: ‘All that is between my
					two hands I dedicate to Lady and Lord and to my growth in the Craft.’  Presto!  You are dedicated to the practice and launched on the
					Wiccan path.</i> (p. 16.)
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<b>FYI</b> -- They also give instructions for a more formal dedication ceremony to those who want more elaborate.  This ceremony
					involves having an altar in the middle of the sacred space upon which will be something (statuette, picture, some appropriate object)
					to represent the Goddess and God respectively.  There is also needed: a grain mixture or a rope to mark out the circle; candles of
					yellow, red, blue, green and white as well as another small candle; incense; two small bowls or cups; salt; a symbol of the person
					herself (e.g., her wand if she has one, or a piece of jewelry she will wear only while working magic, etc.); a robe or cloak to wear.
					They also suggest inviting friends since it is more formal.  The specific instructions for this ceremony are too lengthy to include
					here.  (pp. 17-23.)

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A couple of other things that a beginning witch will be encouraged, and will likely
				want, to do very early in her Wiccan experience is to make a personal tool of some sort (for most it is a wand, though many prefer the
				athame), and also to begin her Book of Shadows.  For most witches, these items, more than anything else, will function as a
				representation of themselves with regard to their Wiccan beliefs.  As a witch creates and embellishes her wand and adds to her Book over
				the years, they will reflect her growth in the knowledge and intuitive understanding of the Craft.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Basic principles</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of knowledge, some of the first lessons a new witch will learn about Wicca will
				concern the two or three general truths which almost all those involved in Wicca recognize.  These are as close to universal rules for Wicca
				as it gets.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, we’ll look at what some call the <i>Wiccan Law</i>.  There are various versions
				(as one might expect by now) but here we will see two -- a long one and a short one. I saw these in several places but took these versions
				from <i>www.theblessedbee.com</i> (so I could cut and paste it).</font></p>

						<b>** FYI</b> -- You may have noticed that the website calls these two versions the <i>Wiccan Rede</i> rather than the <i>Wiccan
						Law</i>.  Some do that while others reserve the term <i>Rede</i> for the advice or counsel of the 26th line of the long version and
						the fourth line of the short version.
					</blockquote>
					</font></p>
				</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All versions of the Wiccan Law contain two key elements which witches would probably
				consider to be two of the most important pieces of wisdom for the Craft. The first element we alluded to in the FYI, the <b>Wiccan
				Rede</b> which goes, "<i>An ye harm none, do what ye will</i>" which essentially means that as long as you do not hurt someone else, you
				are free to do as you please.  There are really no hard and fast rules which, as we noted in the Introduction, is a major attraction of
				Wicca, especially to younger people.  Burroughs and Alupoaicei refer to this as "<i>the cafeteria appeal</i>".   Listen as they comment:
				<blockquote>
					<i>... Wicca is personal and adaptable. ... They can create their own brand of Wicca that works for them.  One Wiccan writes, ‘Really,
					there’s no one true or right way to practice the craft.  Wicca is what you make of it.’  I (Marla) interviewed a teen  named Jessica --
					a soft-spoken articulate girl who wears a pentacle and observes the craft.  When I asked her why she chose to follow Wicca, she said,
					‘Wicca gives me room to breathe.  It’s malleable.  When I practice it, I feel free.  But Christianity seems so rigid.  My parental
					units tell me, "If you don’t do things exactly the way the Bible says, you’re going to hell."’ She smile ruefully but her pain was
					evident. ‘I’m surrounded by spastic Christians,’ she said.</i> (<i>Generation Hex</i>, p. 37.)
				</blockquote>
				<b>FYI</b> -- Though it looks good at first glance there is an obvious problem with trying to make the <i>Rede</i> work in the real
				world.  How can we know for certain that in the choices we make no one else is being harmed?  Often we think that our actions are
				harmless or that if we make questionable choices we only hurt ourselves.  The truth is that we often cannot see the ultimate effects
				of our choices on others and, as the saying goes, "no man is an island".  Furthermore, in Wiccan teachings there are no ultimate
				standards for determining what is good and bad, right and wrong.  What may seem like a benign action to one could be a cancer to
				another.  Whose standard is followed?  Steve Russo cites a high school girl named Kaytee who
				<blockquote>
					<i>is going to use her first spell to help her get the part of Peter Pan in the school play. ‘It’s like prayer,’ she says.  ‘I will
					project that I will get this part of Peter Pan in the musical, <b>harm me none and for the good of all</b>.</i>’  (<i>What’s the Deal
					with Wicca</i>, p. 46.)
				</blockquote>
				Note the seemingly automatic verbal formula at the end of her statement which in reality makes no difference in her decision to cast
				her spell.  She wants the part for herself and if someone else is harmed by losing it ... oh well.  This is an extremely minor example
				but the truth is that Wicca caters to selfishness.  When we always choose only what we want we can become very self-centered and
				self-serving.  Those attitudes are contrary to the self-sacrificing sort of life Jesus calls Christians to live.

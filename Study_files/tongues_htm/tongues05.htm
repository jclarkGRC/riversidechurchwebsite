			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For all the discussion about  'speaking in tongues' these days, the references 
				to the phenomenon in the New Testament are surprisingly limited.  Citing W. Graham Scroggie, Ronald Baxter shares the following 
				breakdown: 
				<ol>
					<li><i>There is one reference only to tongues in the four Gospels.</li>
					<li>There are three distinct references to tongues in the book of Acts.</li>
					<li>There is reference to tongues in only one of the twenty-one epistles of the New Testament...     (Charismatic Gift of 
						Tongues,</i> p.1.)</li>
				</ol></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is from these passages, then, that we must make whatever discoveries and 
				conclusions we can.  Let us proceed.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first mention of tongues in the New Testament is in <b>Mark 16:17</b>.  It is best 
				to read the entire passage from vv. 14-20 so we can see the full context.  This particular text is not used very much by writers 
				in treatments of the spiritual gift of tongues for possibly two reasons:  1)  Because the text here is controversial to some.  
				There have been disputes about whether this portion of chapter 16 was original with Mark or added later based on evidence from 
				early manuscripts (or, rather, the lack of it).  Some do not care to base their views of doctrine on such a passage;  2)  More 
				pertinent to us, there is not a lot of information here about tongues except a prophecy by Jesus that they would appear.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, I do think there are some things that we can find here both plainly 
				and linguistically which will be useful in laying a foundation for the other passages.  Let's start with some of the Greek words.  
				The root for 'tongues' is <i>glossa</i>.  This word is used in only three different ways in the New Testament.  In a pamphlet entitled 
				<i>Tongues...in the Light of the Bible</i>, E.L. Bynum mentions that the word <i>"Glossa" is found 50 times in the New Testament and is 
				translated 'tongues' all 50 times. Sixteen times it refers to the tongue as an organ of the body.  One time it refers to the 
				tongues "like as of fire" on the day of Pentecost.  In the other 33 places it refers to languages as in Revelation 10:11, "...
				before many peoples, and nations, and tongues..."</i>  (p. 3). So we see that there need not be a mystical connotation to the word itself.  
				It was simply the Greek word used to refer to the tongue in your mouth or the language coming out of it.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Likewise the word for 'speak' (root <i>laleo</i>) is just the normal Greek expression 
				for someone saying something.  This, too, is the usual word utilized when we see the phenomenon appear in the Scriptures.  However, 
				the word for 'new' in this passage (root <i>kainos</i>) is not so common in this particular usage.  In fact it is not used at all elsewhere 
				as a modifier for 'tongues' (we will see the other adjectives later in those passages).  What is the meaning of <i>'new'</i> in this 
				instance?  To clarify, does it refer to something never ever seen before at all <b>or</b> does it mean that something is new to those 
				involved in a certain situation?  W.E. Vine, in his <i>Expository Dictionary of Biblical Words</i>,  comments that the word</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p> <i>denotes 'new,' of that which is unaccustomed or unused, not 'new' in time, recent, but 'new' as to form or quality, of 
							different nature from what is contrasted as old. 'The new tongues,' kainos, of Mark 16:17 are the 'other tongues', heteros, 
							of Acts 2:4.  These languages, however, were 'new' and 'different,' not in the sense that they had never been heard before, 
							or that they were new to the hearers, for it is plain from v. 8 that this is not the case; they were new languages to the 
							speakers, different from those in which they were accustomed to speak.</i> (p.431)</p>
					</blockquote>
			<p> Thus, at least here, it seems that <i>'new'</i> does not equate to 'previously unknown.'</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now let's turn to a few simple observations which I think will help set the tone, so to 
				speak, for what we will see later in Acts and I Corinthians.  The first item to note is Jesus' clear indication that this '<i>speak</i>[ing] 
				<i>with new tongues</i>' (along with the other miraculous activities mentioned) are for '<i>signs</i> [which] <i>will follow those who 
				believe</i>' (<b>Mark 16:17</b>).  This is consistent with the other passages we will see and, really, no one disputes that this 
				is the case.  The real question, for our purposes, (and which we will consider later) is for how <i>long</i> do the sign gifts follow 
				believers?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second item of note is in Mark 16:20 which confirms that all this which Jesus predicted 
				actually happened.  In fact the Book of Acts records some very specific examples of such occurrences.  Remember that, even though Mark was very 
				likely the earliest gospel account written, it was not composed until around AD 58. Thus, by that time, the Church had been active and moving 
				for almost 30 years after Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What's the point?  Well, from one point of view, it could be inferred that since the prophecy 
				was fulfilled then it means that such signs are not for today or, at least they are not necessary to fulfill Jesus' prophecy.  Of course, the 
				opposing view might respond by saying that just because we see that it happened in those early days does not mean it cannot continue to happen 
				on into the future and even to today.  What I want to establish is that this passage cannot be used to conclusively prove that tongues are for 
				today <b>or</b> that they are not.  And, of course, that is why the argument is not absolutely settled in the Christian community because either 
				view could be true.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, in fact, we will see that this is the case for all the passages we will examine.  
				There is no place where the Holy Spirit inspired a writer to explicitly tell us the shelf life for His gifts to the Church at large.  But I do 
				believe there is a  preponderance of evidence to be found in the honest exposition of the Scriptures and from that information a person can make 
				a good and sound decision about 'tongues.'</font></p>

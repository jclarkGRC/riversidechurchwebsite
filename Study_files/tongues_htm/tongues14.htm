			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have now discovered the following about the gift of speaking in tongues:
				<ol>
					<li>
						From all indications it was always the ability to speak in an existing human language previously unknown to the speaker;
					</li?
					<li>
						There is nothing in the text of <b>I Corinthians 14</b> to suggest Paul is speaking of a private prayer language or some other 
						phenomenon when he discusses tongues there;
					</li>
					<li>
						That rather than being given for the purpose of evangelism, tongues were clearly given as a sign according to the <b>only</b> 
						scriptures which denote its purpose;
					</li>
					<li>
						This sign was specifically directed at unbelieving Jews who were being warned that they must either accept Jesus as Messiah or 
						be left out of the kingdom altogether.  
					</li>
				</ol>
				For biblical references and further discussion of this please see the preceding segments.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next <b>pertinent question</b> we will consider regards whether this spiritual gift 
				of speaking in tongues, given in those earliest days of the church, is still for the church today.  This question is really the heart of 
				the debate between charismatics and non-charismatics.  Or we might refer to these two groups as <i>continuationists</i> and <i>cessationists</i> 
				(and, no, I didn't make those names up).  The belief of each group is revealed in the name applied to them.</font></p>  
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continuationists affirm that <b>all</b> the spiritual gifts continue to the present day. This 
				includes even the sign gifts (and we have already seen that tongues is one of those). We will take a look at a couple of their main arguments 
				later. Cessationists, on the other hand, assert that certain of the spiritual gifts have ceased to function.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reasoning, in general, for the removal of particular gifts is that they have fulfilled 
				their purpose for being given and, thus, are no longer necessary for the church to function and minister effectively.  Before we go on to speak 
				specifically about tongues, we probably need to address a few matters with regard to this broader issue of spiritual gifts in general.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, it is important to note that nowhere do the Scriptures explicitly delineate the shelf 
				life of any of the spiritual gifts.  In other words we are not told in plain language that certain gifts were meant to expire at some point.  
				And neither is it made crystal clear that all gifts were meant to stay until Jesus returns.  And that is why it is possible to have a debate 
				between two groups of well-meaning, sincere believers in Jesus.  If I have not made it clear to this point, let me do so now:  I am not of the 
				opinion that someone who practices speaking in tongues cannot be a real Christian.  I think that they are mistaken in what they believe about 
				these matters.  And I do not think the practice is helpful in any real sense and may, in fact, be harmful to the church and to them personally 
				in some ways (more on that later). But there is almost no doubt that all of us are mistaken in doctrine on some point or other.  It would take 
				real arrogance for someone to believe they have all the right answers and all the right doctrine and that everyone else who disagrees with them 
				is always wrong.  In any case, this area is not one of those critical or cardinal doctrines which defines Christianity (e.g., one's belief about 
				the trinity, the virgin birth of Jesus, Him  being both divine and human, His death and bodily resurrection, His visible return, and so on).  
				Thus, there is room for disagreement about tongues and spiritual gifts in general within the boundaries of Christ's kingdom.  But having said that, 
				I do believe it is possible to come to a solid decision about tongues (and other gifts) based on the sound exposition of those scriptures which 
				speak to these matters.  To me, when we consider all that is there, understanding the contexts involved, not making unwarranted assumptions,  it's 
				an easy call and a clear choice.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, we mentioned that cessationists believe that certain gifts are not given in the present 
				age because, at some point, they fulfilled their purposes and are no longer needed by the church.  We should probably clarify that statement a bit.  
				There are several ways by which various writers classify spiritual gifts.  Rather than try to incorporate all that is out there I will share the 
				approach I like best as a means of explanation.  I (and others) put spiritual gifts into three categories:  <b>sign</b> gifts, <b>temporary</b> 
				gifts and <b>permanent</b> gifts.  But in explaining this, let's take them in reverse order.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Permanent</i> gifts from the spirit are those which <b>do</b> continue to the present day in 
				the life of the church.  They continue because they are needed and necessary for the church to function and minister effectively in the world.  
				There are four passages in the New Testament where lists of spiritual gifts are provided -- <b>Romans 12:6-8; I Corinthians 12: 8-10; 12:28; 
				Ephesians 4:11.</b>  Whether these lists are meant to be comprehensive or only representative is hard to say but, nevertheless, they are all we 
				have.  The gifts we see listed which I would place in the permanent category are:  ministry; teaching; exhortation; giving; leadership; mercy; 
				faith;  helps; administration; evangelist; pastor-teacher.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two things to point out about these gifts.  They are very useful in the day-to-day life of the 
				church both internally and externally.  In other words, the church will always need leaders and helpers and teachers and givers and evangelists 
				and so on.  But at the same time, these gifts are not overtly supernatural to those seeing them function as, say, a healing or a miracle performed 
				by Jesus or an apostle would be seen.  That is not to say that God does not provide the power to make the one exercising the gift effective in his 
				task or role, but only that it is not necessarily an eye-catching, extraordinary event when these gifts are employed in ministry.  The other gifts 
				are different in that respect.  More on that in the next segment.</font></p>

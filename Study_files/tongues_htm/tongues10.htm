			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 1</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will now begin considering specific aspects of the tongues issue in an attempt to 
				explore the matter thoroughly.  At the end we will seek to tie all of the information together so as to draw reasonable conclusions 
				about this controversial practice which we see happening in a large segment of today's church.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First things first.  Our initial question must be about the nature of the gift of 
				tongues, i.e., what is it exactly? (Or perhaps what <i>was</i> it -- but that's for another question.)  In light of our examination 
				and discussion of the biblical passages during the past several weeks, this question may seem to be somewhat repetitive and moot.  
				As a quick refresher note that we saw:
				<ol>
					<li>That the original Greek root words for 'speak' (<i>laleo</i>) and for 'tongue' (<i>glossa</i>) are always used consistently 
						in all the texts.  This is evidence that the spiritual gift is also consistently the same throughout all the passages.
					</li>
					<li>In Acts 2 we saw the Greek word <i>dialektos</i> (translated as <i>language</i> in vv. 6, 8) used with reference to the 
						phenomenon of uneducated Galileans speaking other human languages. Further, these human languages are thereafter enumerated 
						in vv. 9-11.
					</li>
					<li>In I Corinthians 14 where Paul downplays the importance of tongues in church worship services part of his explanation includes an 
						equation of tongues to world languages in vv. 9-11.  His point is that a lack of understanding is counterproductive to general 
						edification.
					</li>
				</ol></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From these facts I submit that it is reasonable to deduce that the spiritual gift of 
				speaking in tongues was always the same, that is, it was the ability to speak in a language <b>already existing in human culture</b> but 
				which was previously unknown to or unstudied by the speaker himself.  I would also submit that if one is to argue that the gift of tongues 
				was beyond the scope of these parameters then the burden of proof is on him to demonstrate why he thinks so.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, most of us have no problem with this definition of speaking in tongues. But 
				one of the most basic disagreements between us and Pentecostals/Charismatics is precisely at this point.  The first and second wave 
				Pentecostals (see History section pp. 1-4) have always maintained that what they are doing goes beyond the human realm and into a heavenly 
				one.  In other words the gift of tongues, for them, is mostly about speaking languages only God and perhaps angels would understand.   I 
				have already pointed out the paradox that while Pentecostals take their name from that Pentecost recorded in Acts 2 yet they do not, by 
				their own claim, reproduce what happened on that day, that is, they do not speak in other human languages as the Galilean believers were 
				obviously doing.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do they have any biblical basis for this position?  Their most frequently used passage 
				(of which I am aware) is <b>I Corinthians 13:1.</b>  Paul's statement in this first verse of the 'love chapter' seems to confirm that it 
				is possible for someone to speak in an angelic language.  However, there are two very important facts about this passage which make another 
				view very reasonable (and I would say actually even more likely).  First, remember the overall context is Paul's emphasis that producing 
				spiritual fruit -- especially love for your brothers and sisters in Christ -- has a greater priority than practicing spiritual gifts.  In 
				fact, love must the driving force behind exercising one's gifts or they are rendered useless.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, Paul is eager to drive this point home and uses hyperbole to emphasize its 
				importance.  This is clearly seen in the next couple of verses -- <b>read vv. 1-3.</b>  We saw last time that a large part of the problem 
				was the Corinthians' immature stance which desired to have the 'show-off' gifts rather than service gifts.  Paul is using over-the-top 
				illustrations to explain that even the most eye-catching and extreme displays are of no real value unless they are motivated by a desire to 
				look out for someone else's best interests, i.e., <i>agape</i> love.  When you read verse one in this context you realize that Paul was not 
				claiming that he spoke in tongues of angels (any more than he would have claimed to <i>understand all mysteries</i> or to <i>remove mountains</i>) 
				but was simply using something which moved well beyond what they actually did have (<i>tongues of men, prophecy, faith, etc.</i>) to make his 
				point.  To sum up, there seems to be no sound basis to say that the spiritual gift of tongues was anything more than someone suddenly speaking 
				in a human language unknown to him naturally.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next we will take a look at another opinion of what the gift of tongues might have been.  
				This view tries to make the exercising of tongues more palatable for a broader range of believers, whether Charismatic or not.  But does it?  
				We'll see.</font></p>

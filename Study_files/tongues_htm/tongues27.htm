			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 18</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are continuing to examine what might be really happening in today's churches which 
				claim to be practicing the New Testament spiritual gift of speaking in tongues.  We have argued for and taken the position that this gift is of 
				no real use today since the truths it was given to signify have long since either been acknowledged generally (e.g., that Gentiles are included 
				in the church and God's kingdom) or have ceased to be relevant (e.g., no longer any Apostles to be validated) and therefore the Holy Spirit no 
				longer distributes it.  If this is true then how do we explain what is happening in Pentecostal and other types of charismatic churches?  In the 
				previous segment we saw that one possibility is that those who are speaking these ecstatic utterances are, in fact, being influenced by spiritual 
				forces which are not of God.  Scary stuff.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, as I said inthe prior segment, that is probably not what is going on in most of the cases 
				we see here in the United States.  The second possibility often offered as an explanation for why people speak in tongues and what may really be 
				going on is far more common, I believe.  Robert Picirilli (<i>What the Bible Says About Tongues</i>, pp. 21-23) refers to it as 'fakery.'  Perhaps 
				Robert Baxter (<i>Charismatic Gift of Tongues</i>, pp. 75-80) and John MacArthur (<i>Charismatic Chaos</i>, pp.292-95) are a little more charitable 
				when they call it a 'learned response' and 'learned behavior' respectively.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To be fair, Picirilli seems to be focusing more on those who are using the gift of tongues as a 
				means of personal profit.  I do think that there are more than a few unscrupulous individuals who are using to their own advantage the heartfelt 
				desire of thousands of people to experience the supernatural power of God.  These people know exactly what they are doing, they are phonies and 
				'fakers' who want to receive glory and material gain as they 'show' others what God wants for them.  He focuses on these unprincipled and 
				deceitful leaders.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Baxter and MacArthur are addressing more the general idea that when people come to the Lord within 
				the scope of Pentecostal or charismatic churches they are <i>strongly</i> encouraged to speak in tongues.  As has been noted in some of our previous 
				discussions, some of our folks who have been involved in such churches testify to the peer pressure to do so. MacArthur comments to this point:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>Within the charismatic movement, there is great peer pressure to belong, to perform, to have the same gifts and power that everyone else 
							has. The "answer" to spiritual problems is tongues. It is easy to see why tongues has become the great common denominator, the universal 
							test of spirituality, orthodoxy, and maturity for charismatics.  But it is a faulty test. (p. 294.)</i>
						</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think MacArthur is on to something important.  Why is this particular sign gift, among all of them, 
				seen by charismatics as so central to every Christian's spiritual well being?  Why are not the performing of miracles and healing sign gifts for all?  
				The answer is fairly simple:  a person can <b>learn</b> and implement speaking ecstatic, nonsensical utterances but <b>nobody</b> can learn to do real 
				miracles or healings.  In other words you can <b>fake</b> (to use Picirilli's term) words (especially the kind supposedly from heaven which is your own 
				private prayer language that nobody else can verify) but you cannot counterfeit true healings and miracles for long without a lot of manipulation and 
				cooperation from others willing to go along with you.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Baxter and MacArthur both cite examples of 'instructors' helping their listeners figure out how to 
				speak in tongues and become comfortable doing it.  Baxter (p. 76) quotes extensively from a spiel given by a charismatic guru named Don Basham:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>Now the first thing I want to tell you is this: You can sit back and relax, for you can receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit and you can 
							speak in tongues. <b>It is in your power to do all you have to do</b> (emphasis mine).  The same faith that enabled you to receive Jesus 
							Christ as your Savior is all the faith you need to receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit with speaking in tongues.  After all, the baptism, 
							in one sense, is simply receiving more of Jesus.  It's meeting Him in a new dimension, as the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit as John the Baptist 
							spoke of Him in Luke 3:16. There is no reason why everyone of you...will not receive the Holy Spirit and be praising God in a new and unknown 
							tongue within a very few minutes. So relax and be confident. It will happen.</i>
						</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is Basham one of the corrupt leaders? I have no idea. It may very well be that he genuinely believes 
				what he is saying and is simply trying to help.  The point here, though, is that among charismatics there is great interest in teaching the uninitiated 
				how to speak in tongues.  This, of course, begs the question, as MacArthur puts it: <i>"Why a person would have to <b>learn</b> how to receive a gift 
				from the Holy Spirit is baffling."</i> (p.294.) This instruction is not only for adults though. MacArthur also shares the following:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>Someone sent me a sample of some charismatic Sunday school literature designed to teach kindergarten children to speak in tongues.  It is 
							titled "I've been filled with the Holy Spirit!!!" and is an eight-page coloring book. One page has a caricature of a smiling weight-lifter 
							with a T-shirt that says "Spirit-Man." Under him is printed I Corinthians 14:4: "He that speaks in an unknown tongue builds himself up."  
							Another page features a boy who looks like Howdy Doody with his hands lifted up.  A dotted outline pictures where his lungs would be. 
							(This evidently represents his spirit.) Inside the lung-shaped diagram is printed "BAH-LE ODOMA TA LAH-SE-TA NO-MO."  A cartoon-style 
							balloon coming from his mouth repeats the words... A brain-shaped cloud is drawn inside his head with a large question mark in the cloud. 
							Also inside the cloud is printed, "MY MIND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING."  Under the boy I Corinthians 14:14 is printed: "For if I 
							pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful." (Charismatic Chaos, p. 270.)</i>
						</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, MacArthur cites John Kildahl, psychologist, and his partner, Paul Qualben, psychiatrist, 
				who were commissioned to do a long-range study on speaking in tongues.  After all their work, in Kildahl's book <i>The Pyschology of Speaking in Tongues</i>, 
				they reached the strong conclusion that speaking in tongues was nothing more than a "learned phenomenon."  (Ibid.,  p. 293.)  Another possibility 
				in the next segment.</font></p>

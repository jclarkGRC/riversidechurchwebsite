			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 14</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have completed (at least to the degree we probably need to do so) our biblical examination 
				of speaking in tongues in trying to answer questions about what the gift actually was; and about its purpose; and whether it still legitimately 
				continues for today's church.  We spent a lot of time and covered a lot of ground trying to develop answers to those questions (I'm sure some of 
				you are thinking that if this is a "brief" look then you'd hate to see an in depth study of the subject).  So I will not try to review all the 
				whys and wherefores of what we have seen.  But I think it would be good to restate several of our conclusions here so as to have them all in one 
				place and to set up the next pertinent question about tongues.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What have we discovered through an honest examination of the relevant scripture passages?  We 
				have seen that speaking in tongues was a miraculous event where someone spoke in a real, understandable, translatable human language which he or 
				she did not understand or know prior to or after the time of speaking it.  Related to this we saw there is no warrant in the Bible for seeing 
				tongues as something else, like a private prayer language for instance.  We also saw the purpose of tongues was to be a sign and, in view of 
				Paul's Old Testament reference in <b>I Corinthians 14:21</b>, it was <i>primarily</i> a sign to unbelieving Jews of God's judgment if they reject 
				His Christ <i>and</i> of Gentile inclusion in God's kingdom (<b>Acts 10:44-47; 11:15-18</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
				<blockquote>
					<p>** SIDEBAR--Ronald Baxter in his book <i>Charismatic Gift of Tongues</i> (pp. 8-9) cites George E. Gardiner who states in reference to Peter's 
						phrase <i>"at the beginning"</i> in <b>Acts 11:15</b> that <i>"...the outpouring at Cornelius' house followed Pentecost by eight years, yet 
					Peter could not point to any continuous flow of such experience among the </i>[Jewish]<i> churches when he explained to the leaders at Jerusalem 
						what had happened to the Gentiles.  After eight years he must say 'as on us at the beginning,' not 'as on all the churches.' Here is a case 
						where silence is eloquent indeed."</i></p>
					<p>His point is that the phrase at least implies that speaking in tongues was not common even then when we know that it existed.  Baxter himself 
						also comments, <i>"Had Peter been able to point to the event as normative among churches, surely he would not have reached back to Pentecost 
					for confirmation of it."</i></p>  
					<p>In his pamphlet <i>Tongues: Glossolalia and Charismatic Renewal in the Light of the Bible</i> (p. 5),  E.L. Bynum makes a similar point about 
						the relative scarcity of tongues when he shares that I Corinthians was written in AD 57 and that all the other New Testament books except 
						Matthew, Mark and I & II Thessalonians were written in AD 60 or later. Acts was written in AD 65.  So the only books which mention tongues 
						(Mark in one place, Acts in three places, and I Corinthians in chapters 12-14) were either written very early or refer to events which were 
					very early in the life of the church.  None of the others mention speaking in tongues at all.</p>  
					<p>The point?  It seems even in the New Testament apostolic era speaking in tongues was not considered very important except to the immature 
						Christians in Corinth.  And after Paul cracked down on their selfish attitudes and showy displays the practice subsided after AD 57 to the 
						point where it wasn't on the radar except when viewed historically. Food for thought for those who place such importance on it today.</p>
					<p>We also argued that it had a secondary purpose as a sign (along with the other 'miracle' type gifts), that is, it helped validate the true 
						Apostles.  Since those two main purposes were long ago accomplished, (i.e., no one doubts Gentile inclusion in God's kingdom these days and 
						the apostolic office no longer exists) we argued that the cessationist view that the Spirit no longer hands out or grants the gift of speaking 
						in tongues is the correct approach.</p>  
						<p>Finally, we saw that Paul's evaluation of speaking in tongues in worship as seen in <b>I Corinthians 14</b> was overwhelmingly negative.  
							Though he did not forbid the use of tongues, he emphatically encouraged the use of prophecy instead because it was better for the edification 
							of others.</p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now having briefly (there's that word being used incorrectly again) reviewed most of our more important 
				conclusions about tongues, let us consider what is happening in  today's churches where Christians claim to possess the gift and insist on practicing 
				it during worship services.  For one thing, does anyone think that what is coming out of the mouths of these people are real, understandable, translatable 
				human languages?  No.  Cessationists certainly do not.  As we noted earlier in the study, linguistic experts who listen to recorded instances do not.  But 
				even more telling, most charismatics (especially the third wave variety) and continuationists concede that what is being uttered is not real language.  
				They may insist that they are speaking a heavenly or angelic language but this is irrelevant to our point because the gift of speaking in tongues we see 
				<b>in the Bible</b> was <b>not</b> that. What's happening in today's churches in this regard is <b>not</b> a reflection of what happened in the New 
				Testament.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, does the current "manifestation" of tongues in some of today's churches fulfill the stated purpose 
				(<b>cf. Mark 16:17; I Cor. 14:22</b>) of being a validating sign?  As already stated, the primary and secondary purposes as seen or implied in the Bible 
				have been accomplished so it cannot be those.  Some Pentecostals and charismatics might contend that speaking in tongues is a sign that one has received 
				the Holy Spirit and might refer to <b>Acts 2:4; 10:44-46</b> to build the  case.  This was certainly the view of the first and second waves of Pentecostalism.   
				But this does not add up biblically.  If <b>all</b> Christians are to have the Holy Spirit (<b>cf. Romans 8:9; I Cor. 6:19) but not all Christians</b> are 
				supposed to possess the gift of tongues (<b>cf. I Cor. 12:6-11; 27-30</b>), then how can speaking in tongues be <b>the</b> revealing sign that a person has 
				the Holy Spirit dwelling in him?  It cannot.  And indeed third wave charismatics have accepted this argument because they concede that speaking in tongues 
				is not for every believer and that it is not a sign of possessing the Spirit.  We commend them for that but we have still not received an answer about what 
				purpose tongues serves or what sign tongues gives.  We have already addressed the idea that as a sign to unbelieving Gentiles it fails miserably because it 
				creates confusion and chaos (<b>cf. I Cor. 14:23</b>).  Today's tongues do not really signify anything. We continue in the next segment.</font></p>

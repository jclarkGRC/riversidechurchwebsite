			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 6</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our current <b>pertinent question</b> about tongues concerns the primary issue between 
				<i>continuationists</i> (who believe all the gifts continue to the present day) and <i>cessationists</i> (who believe certain of the gifts have 
				ceased to function) which is: <i>Is the gift of tongues for the church today?</i>  The answer to this question needs development so we are taking 
				a quick parenthetical break from tongues specifically to discuss spiritual gifts in general.  Last time I introduced a common notion among 
				cessationists that the spiritual gifts as listed in the New Testament may be categorized as either <i>sign</i> gifts, <i>temporary</i> gifts or 
				as <i>permanent</i> gifts.  We covered the permanent gifts and noted that:
				<ol>
					<li>
						These gifts do continue to the present;
					</li>
					<li>
						They are very practical and useful in church life and;
					</li>
					<li>
						They are much less eye-catching and spectacular than most of the other gifts.
					</li>
				</ol>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moving on in reverse order, then, <i>temporary</i> gifts are those gifts which were also necessary 
				to establishment of the early church, yet at some point were no longer needed or were not intended to extend indefinitely in the church.  These gifts, 
				more than the <i>permanent</i> gifts, also involved an overt, direct manifestation of God's power but in ways maybe not so obvious as to be <b>signs</b> 
				to unbelieving witnesses.  In this category I would put: prophecy; word of wisdom; word of knowledge; discerning of spirits; apostleship and maybe the 
				interpretation of tongues.  Why these?  We will talk more about apostleship later and why it is important to the arguments of the cessationist so let's 
				focus for now on the speaking gifts I noted.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me digress for a moment to note that the two <b>'words of wisdom...knowledge'</b> are not easily 
				categorized.  It could be that the Holy Spirit grants a special measure of insight or logic to a believing individual which he utilizes freely on occasion 
				on behalf of the church at critical times of making hard choices.  If that is the case I would probably be more inclined to include them in the permanent 
				category.  But because Paul uses the phrase <i>'word of wisdom/knowledge'</i> most scholars agree the gifts involved supernatural revelation from the Lord.  
				The difference between the two probably involved the nature of the revelation.  Was it insight and general philosophy for life or was it a specific bit of 
				information needed for a particular situation?  Again these two are difficult to classify precisely.  But if they were direct revelation then I would say 
				they fell into a subset of prophetical utterance.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this point I think it is important for us to be exacting in our definition of prophecy.   Why?  
				Because there is a past and current trend of dumbing down the idea of New Testament prophecy to mean something less than a direct and specific revelation 
				from God.  Instead, they say, New Testament prophecy was (and is) more of an impression, a feeling, or a prompting, if you will, than a direct message from 
				God which the prophet is intended to repeat and declare to his listeners. In his 2009 paper, <i>Is the Gift of Tongues for Today?</i>(p. 12), Robert 
				Picirilli quotes two very well known and well respected  evangelical theologians with regard to this matter. From D. A. Carson's <i>Showing the Spirit</i> 
				(p. 169) he shares:
				<blockquote>
					<p><i>What preacher has not had the experience, after detailed preparation for public ministry, of being interrupted in the full flow of his delivery 
						with a new thought, fresh and powerful, interrupting him and insinuating itself upon his mind, until he makes room for it and incorporates it 
						into his message -- only to find after the service that the insertion was the very bit that seemed to touch the most people, and meet their needs?  
						Most charismatics would label the same experience a "prophecy."</i></p>
				</blockquote>
				And from a 2005 interview by Tim Challies with Wayne Grudem, Grudem says:
				<blockquote>
					<p><i>In people's actual prayer lives as well as in the personal conversation of the pastor in the pulpit to the congregation, people talk about the 
						Lord leading them and guiding them in specific ways. Sometimes in ways it sounds very much like the gift of prophecy to me, but they don't call it 
						prophecy. They call it prompting or leading. I am thankful for all of that and I am very comfortable being in a home fellowship group where people 
						pray and are willing to say how they think the Lord is leading them and guiding them as they pray and what He brings to their minds. And they don't 
						call it prophecy. But I'm thinking, "That sure looks like prophecy to me."</i>,</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are several problems with this approach to New Testament prophecy, and Picirilli addresses them in 
				full, but for the sake of space let me quickly point out two critical issues.  One is that those who take this low view of New Testament prophecy are not 
				all that concerned about accuracy.  In other words it is quite possible the prophet can be mistaken.  In his book <i>Charismatic Chaos</i> (pp. 78-81), 
				John MacArthur cites and discusses the modern  'Kansas City Prophets' who claim to receive revelation from the Lord but are satisfied if <i>'two-thirds'</i> 
				of them are on the mark.  Hardly reassuring for the listener deciding whether to comply with the new revelation!  The second problem is that while I strongly 
				affirm that the Holy Spirit does prompt and lead and guide believers with inner urgings and unbidden thoughts, there is no need to make this equivalent with 
				true revelatory prophecy.  In fact, as Picirilli suggests, I think this should be the experience of <b>every</b> believer. But Paul makes it clear that the 
				gift of prophecy is <b>not</b> given to <b>every</b> believer (nor is any other gift).  That creates a bit of a disconnect in this approach to prophecy.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So if we define prophecy as God speaking directly to someone for the purpose of that person then sharing 
				the revelation, then we easily see that this gift was needed by all the various churches during that period of time in the first century <b>before</b> the 
				canon of the Scriptures was completed.  But afterward?  Prophecy was not needed anymore since the church now had God's full revelation.  Since discerning 
				of spirits was used to verify individual claims of prophecy it, too, was no longer needed.</font></p>

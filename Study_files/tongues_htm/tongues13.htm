			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 4</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We began our questions by discussing the pertinent question regarding the purpose of speaking 
				in tongues.  In other words, why did God give it to some believers, or, what was it good for?  We saw one popular idea that the gift of tongues 
				was primarily aimed at evangelizing those who speak other languages does not really stand up to close scrutiny in <b>Acts 2</b> mainly because 
				those present could actually speak to and understand each other <i>without</i> the need of supernatural intervention.  For that and other reasons 
				we saw, it seems, a practical purpose for tongues of sharing the gospel with a foreigner is not the most likely or logical conclusion.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But more importantly than the logic is the fact that we are actually told in two passages that 
				the purpose of tongues is not evangelism.  The gift was given as a <b><i>'sign'</i> -- cf. Mark 16:17-18; I Corinthians 14:22.</b>  Since it is 
				right there in black and white I am confident all who believe God's word will accept this revelation. But, of course, the information prompts the 
				question:  <i>"But exactly what does speaking in tongues signify?  And to whom?"</i></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is an important inquiry because those who advocate that tongues (and other miraculous sign 
				gifts) continue to the present day argue that such are necessary because of the conflict between God's kingdom and Satan's.  They assert that without 
				"signs and wonders" the church cannot fight effectively against evil and win the souls of men and women, boys and girls.  One of the key figures in 
				the modern charismatic Vineyard movement, John Wimber called it "power evangelism."  John MacArthur comments:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i> Here, then, is the key idea of "power evangelism": miracles prompt saving faith.  Not only that, miracles are <u>more</u> effective than 
							preaching in that regard.  Wimber believes that those who    simply preach the gospel message fall short of true evangelism.  He dubs 
							their approach "programmatic evangelism."  What is needed instead, he says, is "power evangelism." (Charismatic Chaos, </i>p. 166.)
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is Wimber's claim true?  To quickly address this let me refer us to two pertinent passages:  
				<b>Luke 16:27-31; Romans 10:14-17.</b>  Notice that in Jesus' teaching Abraham denied that miraculous events in themselves have the power to convince 
				or convert unbelievers.  Paul, on the other hand, strictly affirmed that saving faith comes through the vehicle of preaching the word of God, the 
				Gospel.  But back to our primary question for tonight: What does tongues signify and to whom?  The passage in <b>Mark</b> is of no help in trying to 
				answer that.  In it Jesus simply says that speaking with new tongues is going to come with no more explanation.  However, we do find more information 
				in <b>I Corinthians 14.</b>  Keep in mind that this is the <b><i>only</i></b> place we are given information about what the gift of tongues is all 
				about.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As one reads v. 22 it certainly seems that perhaps the Third Wave charismatics have it right, i.e., 
				Paul plainly says that <b><i>"tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers;".</i></b>  But there is one important word at the 
				beginning of that verse, which is, <b><i>"Therefore...".</i></b>  This means <b>v. 22</b> is essentially a conclusion  reached by Paul and culminating 
				from prior verses, namely <b>vv. 20-21:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						20 Brethren, do not be children in understanding; however, in malice be babes, but in understanding be mature.
					</li>
					<li>
						21 In the law it is written: “With men of other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; And yet, for all that, they will not hear 
						Me,”says the Lord.
					</li>
					<li>
						22 Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who 
						believe. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				Paul is challenging the Corinthians to come to a real mature understanding about tongues. To that end he cites an Old Testament reference which contains 
				elements of <b>Deuteronomy 28:47-51:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						47 “Because you did not serve the Lord your God with joy and gladness of heart, for the abundance of everything, 
					</li>
					<li>
						48 therefore you shall serve your enemies, whom the Lord will send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in need of everything; 
						and He will put a yoke of iron on your neck until He has destroyed you. 
					<li>
						49 The Lord will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you will 
						not understand, 
					</li>
					<li>
						50 a nation of fierce countenance, which does not respect the elderly nor show favor to the young. 
					</li>
					<li>
						51 And they shall eat the increase of your livestock and the produce of your land, until you are destroyed; they shall not leave you grain or 
						new wine or oil, or the increase of your cattle or the offspring of your flocks, until they have destroyed you.
					</li>
				</ul>
			and especially <b>Isaiah 28:11-12:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						11 For with stammering lips and another tongue He will speak to this people,
					</li>
					<li>
						12 To whom He said, “This is the rest with which You may cause the weary to rest,” And, “This is the refreshing”; Yet they would not hear.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What are these about?  One is a prophecy by Moses and one by Isaiah.  Both are against an unbelieving 
				Israel who chooses not to listen to warnings from God through His prophets.  In essence, since God's people, the Jews, would not listen to one speaking 
				in their own language, God will send them a more forceful message and they will hear the tongue of a different nation in their midst after they have 
				been overcome by a foreign army.  They are prophecies of impending judgment.  Hearing the foreign language in their midst would signify it had been 
				fulfilled.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus we see that this gift of tongues is not random, rather it has, as Richard Baxter in his 
				<i>Charismatic Gift of Tongues</i> (p.42) says, <i>"an Old Testament base."</i>  Paul is applying this scripture(s) to the then current gift of tongues.  
				Therefore the <i>'unbelievers'</i> of <b>v. 22</b> is directly connected to <i>'this people'</i> (or Jews) of <b>v. 21.</b>  This gift of tongues, then, 
				is a specific warning to the Jews about the impending judgment upon their nation.  What judgment?  That God was about to end the seventy week covenant 
				with Israel and establish a new people of God based on faith rather than on bloodlines.  They needed to hear the message of Jesus and respond or be left 
				out of the kingdom altogether.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is consistent with what happened in <b>Acts 2</b> on Pentecost and <b>Acts</b> 10 in the home of 
				Cornelius.  The Jews were faced with revelation that God was moving and that Gentiles were included reinforced with a sign of authenticity.  This also 
				explains Paul's statement in <b>I Corinthians 14:18</b> since he always went to the synagogues first in a new city and then after being rejected, 
				typically, turned to preach to Gentiles.  His use of tongues was a sign to unbelieving Jews.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, it helps explain the apparent contradiction between <b>v. 22</b> and <b>vv. 23-24</b>:
				<ul>
					<li>
						22 Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe.
					</li>
					<li>
						23 Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those who are uninformed or unbelievers, 
						will they not say that you are out of your mind?
					</li>
					<li>
						24 But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an uninformed person comes in, he is convinced by all, he is convicted by all.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Since tongues was primarily for Jews not Gentiles, in the church there was little use for it.  Any bloodline Jews who were there were already believers and 
				did not need the warning.  The rest were Gentiles to whom it had no real meaning.  Thus the need for interpreters so if it was to be done in the church 
				everyone could understand what was being said.  If it was disorderly and not interpreted then most newcomers (Gentiles) would think they were insane.</font></p>

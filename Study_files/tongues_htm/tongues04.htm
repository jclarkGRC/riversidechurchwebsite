			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What we are seeing today is a further development of charismatic teaching and 
				practice.  For brevity's sake we can trace the <i>third wave</i> of Pentecostalism (or charismatic teaching) to the late 1970s/early 1980s 
				and especially to John Wimber and what eventually became known as the Vineyard Church movement.  Whereas the main difference between 
				the 'first' and 'second' wave had to do more with the ones involved (i.e., members of a traditional Pentecostal denomination in the 
				first wave versus the second wave intrusion into traditionally non-Pentecostal groups) the <i>third wave</i> is different by way of its actual 
				teachings about charismatic tongues.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do I mean by that?  Picirilli, in a paper presented at the 2009 FWB national 
				convention, notes that <i>"These phenomena</i> [tongues and other sign gifts], <i>however (and here the Vineyard churches break with traditional 
			Pentecostalism), are not evidences of baptism in the Spirit and are not to be expected for every believer"</i> (p. 2).  He then summarizes 
				the views of what he calls a <i>'mildly charismatic'</i> element of Christendom represented by Christian thinkers like Wayne Grudem and D.A. 
				Carson who are outside the traditional circles of the charismatics.  Picirilli believes that, though there are a few distinctions, the 
				main difference between these 'mildly charismatic' and the true 'third wave' is more a matter of "emphasis" than of doctrinal differences 
				on the subject. The highlights of their positions are:
				<ul>
					<li>Both tongues and prophecy in 1 Corinthians and the church today, are in important respects different from their earlier appearances 
						in the Bible.  New Testament prophecy is not like Old Testament prophecy.  The tongues at Corinth were different from those in 
						Acts 2.</li>
					<li>Both gifts are therefore less spectacular than usually thought.  Prophecy is “speaking merely human words to report something God 
						brings to mind.”  Tongues are not human languages but a language for prayer, preferably exercised in private.</li>
					<li>Neither gift is required for all Christians, although they are valuable and might be experienced by any believer.  Such “gifts 
						of the Spirit” are as much events as endowments to be possessed by persons.</li>
					<li>Neither gift signifies advanced spirituality, but prophecy in the public assembly is a sign of God’s blessing and tongues 
						enhance one’s prayer life. (<i>Is the Gift of Tongues for Today?</i>, p.3) </li>
				</ul></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Picirilli expresses a sense of 'gratification' (p. 3) in that the arguments of those 
				who resisted the 'second wave' onslaught of Pentecostalism have apparently proven effective.  He notes that the 'third wave' and the 
				'mildly charismatic' <b>agree</b> that: 
				<ol>
					<li>The tongues in Acts 2 were human languages and that today's charismatics are <b>not</b> speaking human languages.</li>
					<li>That speaking in tongues is <b>not</b> the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that Acts 2 does not record a kind of "Spirit 
						baptism" that every Christian needs to experience subsequent to salvation.</li>
					<li>That tongues are <b>not</b> for every believer and need not be used in public at all. (Ibid.)</li>
				</ol></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That brings us up to date for the most part with the history and development of the 
				Pentecostal or charismatic gift of tongues.  Next, we will start on the Biblical passages and the issues at hand.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 20</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are coming rapidly to the close (I think) of our study about the modern practice of 
				speaking in tongues in Christian circles.  We have covered a lot of ground.  We have reviewed the history of this sort of tongues-speaking 
				and have tried to look at all the pertinent passages with a view to considering the context and what the verses are actually trying to 
				communicate.  Finally we have tried to answer specific pertinent questions which I have tried to formulate based on what seem to be most 
				people's concerns about this issue.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last <b>pertinent question</b> (again...I think) is:  <i>Is there any real harm in 
				the modern practice of speaking in tongues?</i>  In other words, what real difference does it make if a group of Christians or if an individual 
				believes that the Holy Spirit still gives out this sign gift?  So what if they decide to make ecstatic speaking part of their worship?  Does 
				that mean that they are not true believers or have forfeited their salvation?  If not, then what's the problem with something that makes them 
				feel good or more spiritual (i.e., it <i>edifies</i> them)?  Are we cessationists who create studies  or write papers or books critiquing this 
				practice causing unnecessary division?  Are we troublemakers?  These are fair questions which deserve an answer.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, let me say (again) that I do <b>not</b> believe that if a professing Christian practices 
				speaking in tongues (whether publicly in a church service or privately in prayer) that this in itself disqualifies him or her from being a born 
				again Christian.  I  do vehemently disagree with the person's doctrinal position on the matter but the same could be said of a multitude of 
				various issues with other denominations and theologies.  The acid test of someone's salvation is not a particular doctrinal stance but it is, 
				rather, the possession of true faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.  This faith should create a hunger and obedience for biblical truth which should, 
				in turn, cause most believers to resemble each other closely (especially as compared with unbelievers6) but there <i>is</i> room for honest 
				disagreement in nonessential biblical teachings.  John MacArthur is to the point in his <i>Charismatic Chaos</i> (pp. 298-99) as he writes:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>"We can thank God for charismatic and Pentecostal people who believe in the Word of God.  We can be grateful that they believe the 
							Bible and hold it up as authoritative, though we are concerned about their view of revelation.  We can also praise God that they 
							believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, his sacrificial death, his physical resurrection, salvation by faith not works, and the need 
							to live in obedience to Christ, fervently love their fellow man, and proclaim the faith with zeal."</i>
						</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He then follows that statement with one that addresses the question of whether studies and 
				writings like this create needless controversy:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>"Some might say, 'Why criticize them?'  We do so because it is scriptural to be concerned about whether our brothers and sisters 
							are walking in the truth.  Although it may not seem very loving to some, the Bible is clear that we are to 'speak the truth in love' 
							(Eph. 4:15).  True love must act on the truth."</i>
						</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And there is more to it than just a difference of doctrinal opinion.  The reason good doctrine 
				is important in the first place is that it eventually shows up in real life situations.  In other words there are consequences when a person 
				misinterprets the Bible and goes in a direction that is not according to God's will.  Once more let me refer to MacArthur's book as he cites 
				three men who were all once involved with the charismatic tongues movement (Ibid., pp. 273-74).  The first is the late George Gardiner, a pastor, 
				who wrote:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>"The enemy of the soul is ever ready to take an advantage of an 'out of control' situation and thousands of Christians can testify with 
							regret to the end results. Such experiences not only give Satan an opening he is quick to exploit, they can be psychologically damaging 
							to the individual.  Charismatic writers are constantly warning tongues-speakers that they will suffer a letdown. This is ascribed to the 
							devil and the reader is urged to get refilled as soon as possible. ...  So the seeker for experience goes back through the ritual again 
							and again, but begins to discover something:  ecstatic experience, like drug addiction, requires larger and larger doses to satisfy.  
							Sometimes the bizarre is introduced.  I have seen people run around a room until they were exhausted, climb tent poles, laugh hysterically, 
							go into trances for days and do other weird things as the 'high' sought became more elusive.  Eventually there is a crisis and a decision 
							is made; he will sit on the back seats and be a spectator, 'fake it,' or go on in the hope that everything will eventually be as it was.  
							The most tragic decision is to quit and in the quitting abandon all things spiritual as fraudulent.  The spectators are frustrated, the 
							fakers suffer guilt, the hoping are pitiable and the quitters are a tragedy.  No, such movements are not harmless!"</i>
						</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another testimony comes from Wayne Robinson,  once on the staff of the Oral Roberts Evangelistic 
				Association, who penned:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>"In the past few years I have become more and more convinced that <b>the</b> [emphasis his] test, not only of tongues but of any religious 
							experience cannot be limited to the logic and truthfulness supporting it.  There is also the essential question, 'What does it do in 
							one's life?'  More specifically, does it turn a person inward to self-concern and selfish interests, or does it open him up to others 
							and their needs?  I know people who testify that speaking in tongues has been the great liberating experience of their lives.  But 
							juxtaposed with them are a great many others for whom speaking in tongues has been an excuse to withdraw from confronting the realities 
							of a suffering and divided world.  For some, tongues has been the greatest thing ever to happen; others have seen it disrupt churches, 
							destroy careers, and rupture personal relationships."</i>
						</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, former charismatic Ben Byrd writes:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>"To say that speaking in tongues is a harmless practice and is all right for those who want to IS AN UNWISE [emphasis his] position 
							when information to the contrary is evident. ... Speaking in tongues is addictive.  The misunderstanding of the issue of tongues and 
							the habit plus the psychic high it brings plus the stimulation of the flesh equals a practice hard to let go of. ... [But to] equate 
							much speaking in tongues with advanced spirituality is to reveal one's misunderstanding of Bible Truth and to reveal one's willingness 
							to be satisfied with a deceptive and dangerous counterfeit."</i>
						</p>
				</blockquote>

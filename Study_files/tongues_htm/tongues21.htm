			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 12</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the preceding segment we began looking at, what I believe, is the most powerful argument 
				cessationists have to make with regard to their position on speaking in tongues and the sign gifts in general.  That argument has to do with 
				the role of the apostles in that early, critical, transitional phase of establishing the church of Jesus Christ.  We saw in <b>Hebrews 2:3-4</b> 
				a three-link chain for the origination and propagation of the message of salvation.  That chain was from Jesus (<i>'the Lord'</i>) to the Apostles 
				(<i>'those who heard Him'</i>) with the message being <i>'confirmed to us'</i> through <i>'signs and wonders,...with various miracles, and gifts 
				of the Holy Spirit.'</i>  <i>'Us'</i> would be in this case everyone after the Apostles in the chain.  Notice that the message is confirmed 
				<b><i>to</i></b> us, not <b><i>by</i></b> or <b><i>through</i></b> us.  This seems to oppose those who say that such signs are still needed today 
				for the gospel to be effective (e.g., John Wimber, Vineyard teaching, et. al.).  Furthermore, we saw that the pattern in Acts supports this view.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's explore this principle a bit further in the context of the entire scope of the Bible and I 
				will begin by asking a question.  <i>How common are instances when God calls and grants power to a person or persons to perform supernatural, grade 
				A sorts of miracles?</i>  ("Anyone? Anyone?...Bueller? Ferris Bueller?")  The answer is: <i>Not really all that often.</i>  The instances of a 
					prolonged series of supernatural events coming through the agency of a man called and sent by God has happened exactly three times.  The first 
					time was with Moses and his protégé Joshua, the second was with Elijah and his successor Elisha and the third was Jesus and then the Twelve.  
					Each of these times was a critical period in God's plan for mankind.  The first was, of course, the Exodus of Israel from Egypt and the planting of 
					a people who could testify of God at the crossroads of the world at that time.  The second seems to be a last ditch effort to call an apostate 
					northern ten tribes of Israel back to faith.  Not long after their passing Israel was conquered by Assyria and taken into captivity.  And, of 
					course, Jesus and His followers, the Apostles, brought the message of salvation by grace through faith in Christ to the world.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on these facts, I would submit that just as those intense periods of signs and wonders faded 
				after the passing of Moses and Joshua and again after Elijah and Elisha, so such things were meant to fade after the passing of the Apostles from the 
				scene.  In other words, the overall picture stays consistent in this view.  Someone may object that such gifts might still be very useful today to get 
				people's attention -- why was it needed then in the early church and not today?  Since there was no completed written canon of Scripture, the authority 
				of the Apostles as God's chosen leaders for the church needed to be validated.  Their teachings and writings then became the doctrine to which 
				Christianity subscribes and by which it is defined. Most of the church (and I would say <i>all</i> of the <b>true</b> church) accepts the Bible as 
				completed.  If that is true, and we have all the necessary information God has seen fit to give us, then modern 'apostles' and 'prophets' serve no 
				real purpose.  And in fact, aren't such who claim those offices and gifts in reality <i>adding</i> to God's word?  They would deny that.  I do not 
				know of any charismatics who preach who do not at least start with the Bible.  I have not heard of anyone (though I confess I may be uninformed) who 
				ignores the Bible, makes a statement, calls it a prophecy and then proceeds to preach his statement as equal to an actual Bible passage.  I am glad 
				of the higher regard for Scripture but the position itself is inconsistent.  If revelation and prophecy from the Bible is on a different level then 
				why not stick with that alone rather than throw in your own supposed prophecies and tongues?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since we allow (and most do) for the possibility, and more, the likelihood that at least some of 
				the gifts and offices like apostleship, prophecy, miracles, and healings have faded because of the passing of that transitional period and the passing 
				of the apostles, then it is not unreasonable to suppose that the other sign gifts have as well.  We have already seen that tongues are clearly stated 
				to be a sign gift. We also made the argument that it was specifically a sign to unbelieving Jews that the salvation paradigm had changed and judgment 
				awaits those who do not accept Jesus as Messiah.  Why would that not be useful today?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, included in all this was the new idea to those first century Jews that Gentiles are now invited 
				to be part of the kingdom of God.  <b>Acts 8-11</b> chronicles that process.  It was, as Robert Picirilli calls it, <i>'a slow and agonizing one.' (What 
				the Bible Says About Tongues,</i> p.15.)  But it was a journey finally completed.  Paul's ministry to the Gentiles (<b>cf. Acts 13:46; 18:6; 28:25-28)</b> 
				in the balance of that same book was a huge factor.  It may be, as I have surmised, that at each of those junctures Paul spoke in tongues as a sign and a 
				warning to the unbelieving Jews listening to him.  But later, and today, who would doubt Gentile inclusion in the church?  Unbelieving Jews still need 
				Christ, of course, but would speaking in tongues to them help?  Doubtful.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which brings us to the last short point for this session.  Sign gifts were meant to signify and validate 
				-- not to evangelize.  That statement may be a little confusing so  let me clarify. For people disinclined to believe in Jesus and the salvation He offers 
				all the miracles in the world from God performed right before their eyes would not suffice to change their minds.  They would simply dismiss and discount 
				or say they were done by some other means (<b>cf. Matthew 12:24</b>).  We see that today -- the world is not flocking to Jesus because of the "miracles" 
				certain ones claim to perform.  Signs and wonders helped those with an "ear to hear" to know who was truly from God and could be believed (<b>cf. John 3:2</b>).  
				Faith does not come by seeing miracles.  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God (<b>cf. Romans 10:17</b>).</font></p>

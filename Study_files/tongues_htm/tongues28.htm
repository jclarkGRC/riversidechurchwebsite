			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 19</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are continuing to think about what might really be happening in today's tongues-speaking 
				churches since I am insisting that the Holy Spirit has not given that gift to Christians since the days of the Apostles.  We have considered 
				the possibility that many (if not most) Pentecostal or charismatic believers speak in tongues because they are encouraged and instructed to 
				do so.  In other words, it is learned behavior rather than being something truly from the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third and final possibility we will examine regarding what's going on when a person speaks 
				in tongues these days has to do with the mind, or perhaps more accurately, the lack thereof as it happens.  This one is somewhat of a corollary 
				to what we saw before.  Our three main authors refer to it in different ways and, again, with slightly different emphases.  Robert Picirilli 
				(<i>What the Bible Says About Tongues</i>, pp. 21-23) calls it "emotional expression" while John MacArthur (<i>Charismatic Chaos</i>, pp. 295-297) 
				says they can be "psychologically induced" and Ronald Baxter (<i>Charismatic Gift of Tongues</i>, pp. 80-82) says that tongues "by-passes the 
				intellect."</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Picirilli observes that <i>"People who are charged emotionally can do unusual things."</i>  
				He then describes a time of revival in Tennessee and Kentucky as recounted in <i>History of Middle Tennessee Baptists</i> which was accompanied 
				by several unusual phenomena.  Among the behaviors were: bending over and barking like dogs; falling down stiff as in a trance, sometimes for 
				hours; and uncontrollable jerking.  He suggests that at least part of the reason for these things happening repeatedly during that time was that 
				some expected to have them, or desired to have them, or, if they professed to not desire them, were affected on a subconscious level, even to 
				the point of self-hypnosis.  In other words the power of suggestion over the mind had a powerful effect in those instances.  His point is that 
				similar things can happen in a church where, during a highly charged time of spiritual fervor, people have certain expectations or desires for 
				tongues or other phenomena to break out.  I myself recall being in an especially emotional revival service which was set off by the shouts of 
				one man who was moved spiritually to praise the Lord regarding the coming glory of heaven.  It sort of rippled through the rest of the 
				congregation and others began to shout and weep and reconcile with each other.  It is a very common thing for people to feed off and be 
				influenced emotionally by each other.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MacArthur's comments about this possibility are a bit more technical in nature.  He say that 
				some tongues-speakers go into "motor automatism" which is <i>"clinically described as radical inward detachment from one's conscious surroundings.  
				Motor automatism results in disassociation of nearly all voluntary muscles from conscious control."</i>  He uses the example of young teenage 
				girls at a rock concert who <i>"in the excitement and the emotion, the fervor and the noise...literally give up voluntary control of their vocal 
				cords and their muscles.  They fall to the floor in a paroxysm."</i>  He compares this state to that of being hypnotized and then notes how open 
				listeners are in televised charismatic services: <i>"The people in the audiences nod and amen everything that is said from the platform, even 
				novel and bizarre teachings.  They submit easily to the power of suggestion and do whatever is being suggested.  When emotions get high and 
				pressure mounts, anything might happen."</i>  And, we might add, it often does in some services.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally Baxter comments <i>"What I am now charging is that the modern achievements of tongues 
				necessitates that the seeker lay aside that which most marks his personhood, namely his mind and thought control."</i>  He also gives an example 
				of how this sort of thing happens.  A friend of his on a cruise witnessed the following in a gathering of charismatics led by Demos Shakarian 
				who founded the Full Gospel Businessmen's Fellowship:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>"Instructions were given for those present to form a circle with finger tips only touching.  The they were told to begin to "loosen 
							up" by vigorously shaking their arms which soon began to tingle.  Finally, they were directed to begin saying, 'Jesus...Jesus...Jesus,' 
							over and over, louder and louder, faster and faster.  Soon people were speaking in tongues.  Some were dropping physically to the floor 
							in a trance-like state.  All seemed involved in an ecstatic frame of mind.  My friend ended his account by saying simply, "I think they 
							hypnotized themselves!"</i>
						</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are these authors (or am I) insulting charismatics when we suggest, in essence, that those who speak 
				in tongues may not be in their right minds when they do it?  No.  In fact, charismatics seem to embrace this aspect of tongues speaking.  They see 
				<b>I Corinthians 14:14</b> as validation for it.  We saw that verse being used last time in the kindergarten age Sunday school curriculum teaching 
				children about tongues.  Charismatics believe this is the proper approach to speaking in tongues.  The mind must be disengaged and the spirit in 
				complete control, they assert, for it to happen as it should.  Baxter quotes Oral Roberts:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>"Our intellect is one of the great forces that makes us different from all other creatures. ... Our intellect is that against which we 
							struggle the longest. We do not want to submit it.  But God is Spirit and He cannot be reasoned out. ... Paul reached a point where he 
							had to bend his intellect, and if he could bend his giant intellect we can certainly afford to bend ours. At times he had to quit 
							talking in his own language and quit thinking in his own mind. He simply prayed in tongues and let his spirit reach upward to God."</i>
						</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already addressed the above verse in a previous segment, so suffice it to say that rather 
				than endorsing turning off the mind in certain circumstances, Paul is really saying that he'd rather pray (and sing) in a language he 
				<b><i>understands</i></b> so he (and others) can be fully edified (<b>cf. vv. 15-17</b>).  This approach is consistent with the rest of Scripture 
				which <b><i><u>never</u></i></b> advocates that we should ever lay aside our sanity, our sobriety, our self-control, or our good judgment for any 
				reason.  To the contrary we are instructed repeatedly in God's word to be sober and self-controlled at all times and throughout life.  Consider the 
				following passages:  <b>Proverbs 16:32; Acts 26:25; Romans 12:3; I Timothy 3:2-3; Titus 1:8; 2:1-12.</b></font></p>

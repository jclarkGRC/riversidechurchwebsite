			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 13</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before continuing on to the next question I want to clarify something important.  In the last 
				segment, we looked at the relative scarcity of overt, obvious, grade A miracles and "miracle-workers" in the Bible.  We named the lives and times 
				of Moses and Joshua, Elijah and Elisha, and Jesus and the Twelve as the three main periods of sustained miraculous activity.  And further I 
				suggested that after each period, that sort of thing faded, having accomplished what it was meant to do.  Thus, the vast majority of history 
				He has handled another way.  The main point is that God's usual pattern is not to work in this manner and so to view the sign gifts and a few 
				others as being discontinued (so to speak) is consistent with past similar episodes.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However I am <b>not</b> saying that, because God does not usually work the way He did in those 
				three specific periods of time, then He is not working at all!  Neither am I saying that God never performed miracles outside those periods 
				(Daniel and his friends are an obvious example).  But there are some differences and I will note two.  One is that, for example, Daniel and 
				company, never seemed to be empowered to "perform" (if I may use the word this way) miracles.  Rather they prayed and God answered (Nebuchadnezzar's 
				dream), or they were being obedient and God protected (fiery furnace, lion's den), or God moved on His own and used them to expedite matters 
				(Nebuchadnezzar's insanity, handwriting on the wall).  Without doing an extensive amount of digging, just off the top of my head, it seems to me 
				that this is true of most, if not all, of the characters in the Bible who were in the vicinity of truly miraculous events.  This is a fine line I 
				admit because some of what Moses, Joshua, Elijah and Elisha did was similar in that they prayed and God responded.  Nevertheless, to me at least, 
				there seems to be a difference.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second difference is, I think, more distinctive.  I submit that most of the time God worked 
				through things which <i>could</i> be chalked up to coincidental circumstances.  There are examples all through the Bible.  The book of Esther is 
				perhaps the classic case.  Those who have faith can see God's hand all through the book (e.g., Esther being chosen as queen, the king's sleepless 
				night where he becomes aware of Mordecai's service, and so on).  Yet in the entire record, the name of the Lord God is not even mentioned once!  
				An unbelieving onlooker might marvel at the turn of events but does it have to be supernatural?   There are others.  David's slaying of Goliath -- 
				did it have to be a miracle or was it just a lucky shot?  Jonah being swallowed by a whale -- unlikely yes, but impossible without God's help?  
				You get the point.  Believers see and recognize God's hand at work in these and other cases but that doesn't mean everyone will see such things 
				the same way.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just so, I think that the Lord works much the same way today.  Some charismatics might 
				suggest that I "limit" God when I say that.  I don't think I do.  I believe the Lord is very active in the affairs of men.  And I think that at 
				times He intervenes and does something which is beyond our power and which we cannot understand. He gives a true miracle.  He heals, He helps, 
				He gives peace we perhaps should not be feeling in view of the circumstances we sometimes face, and so on.  But I think that He does that in 
				response to the heartfelt cries of His children.  In other words, He answers prayer.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And at other times, perhaps most of the time, He does things just within the fringes of what 
				could be seen as coincidence.  And while onlookers may talk about how fortunate you are, you know the truth is that you have been blessed by your 
				benevolent Heavenly Father because you prayed and He answered.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does that make sense?  To summarize, I am not suggesting in this study that because the Lord has 
				ceased handing out the "miraculous" class of spiritual gifts, that therefore He has ceased to give miracles or even be at work in the world.  I am 
				simply saying that I do not believe that He places those gifts of healing, or of miracles, and so on in a particular person anymore.  Their purpose 
				of validating the office of the apostle as God's chosen authority to guide and direct His church is no longer needed.  Likewise with tongues, 
				the purpose of signifying that Gentiles are to be included in God's kingdom is now no longer unnecessary.  And maybe even harmful.  More on that 
				later.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So if what we have suggested and seen is the real deal, then what is happening exactly in those 
				churches which claim that such gifts as these are still around and are attempting to practice them?  We'll start looking at that in the next 
				segment.</font></p>

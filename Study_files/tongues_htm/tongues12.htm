			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 3</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our first <b>pertinent question</b> segment we considered the nature of the spiritual 
				gift of speaking in tongues, or in other words, what <i>was</i> it exactly?  We saw that there is only one passage (<b>Acts 2</b>) which 
				actually describes what was happening as the gift was being exercised.  There it is plain that what was being spoken were human languages.  
				Since the same Greek words for '<b>speak</b>' and '<b>tongue</b>'  are used in the other four passages which predict, record or address the 
				use of tongues it would seem most reasonable to conclude that the gift of tongues was the same throughout.  This is a critical determination 
				because a large point of contention between charismatics and non-charismatics is how charismatics redefine tongues as either a heavenly 
				language or a private prayer language.  I would submit there is no biblical warrant for doing that   The one trying to make such a 
				distinction between Acts 2 and I Corinthians 14 must shoulder the burden of proof.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If we accept that the spiritual gift of tongues was always the miraculous ability to speak 
				in a language previously unknown to the speaker, we can turn to the next logical question.  What was the purpose of the gift?  In other 
				words, <b><i>why</i></b> did the Holy Spirit settle on this particular manifestation of supernatural power?  Or more to the point perhaps, 
				what was it really good for?  As we have been reading in I Corinthians 12-14 it seems to have created more problems than it solved in the 
				church.  I think it is a fair statement to say that the same is true today.  But back to the question.  What was the primary purpose of 
				speaking in tongues?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has been suggested by some that God had a very practical purpose for granting to some 
				the ability to speak in languages they did not know.  Indeed some might say that <b>Acts 2:7-11</b> paints a very clear picture.  It seems 
				obvious that God's heart is for evangelism and He gave these Galileans the ability to speak in foreign languages so those from other countries 
				could hear the gospel.  But is this so?  Certainly the Lord received glory from this event and later in the chapter some three thousand are 
				saved.  Nevertheless I would submit that this idea about evangelism being the primary purpose of tongues has some fairly sizable flaws.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, the idea that the listeners in this passage from those other nations <i>needed</i> 
				this miracle to be able to comprehend and understand the message is clearly wrong.  It is almost certain that all the people present during 
				this event had, not one, but two languages in common with each other.  The common trade language was, of course, Greek and most people had 
				an understanding of it.  That all the original and early New Testament manuscripts were written in koine' Greek underscores this truth.  
				Beyond that we see in <b>v. 5, 10</b> that the listeners we are discussing are Jews and proselytes.  So most, if not all, of them would 
				also be able to speak in Aramaic, a form of Hebrew.  Need more proof about this idea of these foreigners already having a common language?  
				Did you note in <b>v. 7</b> that these men from the various nations were able to speak <i>to each other</i> about what was happening right 
				there before their eyes (or, rather, right there into their ears)?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider also the fact that in <b>v. 14</b> Peter begins to preach to the entire crowd 
				and it wasn't until he finished that 3000 were saved.  Are we to suppose that his message was somehow in more than one language?  I guess 
				it is possible that he spoke and then various ones interpreted into foreign languages as needed.  Or maybe Peter spoke and the listeners 
				miraculously heard his words in their own language.  Indeed, some have supposed that this was really what was happening the whole time.  
				We have already addressed this but let me once again quote Robert Picirilli:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>Some interpreters attempt to make this a miracle of hearing, saying the people heard in languages not being spoken at all.  But 
							surely the phrase "in our tongues" (2:11) modifies "speak," not "hear."  Likewise 2:6.  I doubt that such a strange interpretation 
							of the record would ever have been thought of had there not been a need to justify some kind of "tongues" other than real languages.  
						(What the Bible Says about Tongues, p. 7.)</i>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				I also commented at that point that:  "If it was a miracle of hearing, and not of speaking, then why didn't <i>all</i> the men present 
				understand (<b>cf. Acts 2:13</b>)?  And I might also add that it <b><i>is</i></b> called the gift of 'tongues,' <b><i>not</i></b> the gift 
				of 'ears.'"</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point is that while there <i>are</i> other possibilities involved in this matter, 
				the simplest and most straightforward conclusion is that though the Galileans did speak in all these different languages, and the Jews 
				from other places understood them, yet they all had at least one common language with which they could and did communicate.  This truth 
				at the very least undermines the idea that the main purpose of speaking in tongues was to evangelize those who did not speak  the language 
				of the one witnessing to them.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider one other thing.  If we allow (for the sake of argument) that the true gift of 
				tongues continues today, and if evangelism is the main purpose, then why do missionaries have to spend so much time in language school?  
				It would seem that if the Holy Spirit was going to give anyone such a gift it would be those who are called to go to other places in the 
				world to share the gospel.  <b><i>Unless</i></b>, of course, breaking down language barriers for evangelism wasn't the primary reason God 
				granted this gift?  I submit that it was not.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then what was the purpose?  We do not have to guess.  Two of our five passages tell us that 
				it was given for a <b><i>'sign.'</i></b>   But a sign of what?  That's for the next segment.</font></p>

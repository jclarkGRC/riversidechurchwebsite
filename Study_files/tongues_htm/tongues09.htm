			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Biblical Passages - 5</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this segment we will conclude our overview of the biblical passages which record 
				actual occurrences  of someone exercising the gift of tongues or which address them in some other fashion.  <b>I Corinthians 14</b> 
				falls into the latter category.  Paul has set the stage for his commentary and instructions about the gift of tongues by reminding his 
				readers that believers are to be unified as a body even though they are diverse as individuals.  This unity is made possible for two reasons.  
				One is that the one and only Holy Spirit is source of all the gifts and He decides who gets what.  The second reason is that bearing spiritual 
				fruit (especially that of Christian love) is more important than exercising spiritual gifts.  All these principles are given by Paul in 
				chapters twelve and thirteen which we examined in the last segment.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having given some general principles Paul begins to specifically focus on the main issue 
				with regard to spiritual gifts which seems to be causing most of the trouble in the church at Corinth.  That issue was the inability of the 
				Corinthians to properly evaluate the relative worth of the gifts in relationship to one another.  Recall that in <b>12:31</b> Paul encourages 
				them to <i>'desire the best gifts'</i> before sharing with them the overriding principle of love in chapter thirteen.  Now in chapter 
				fourteen he returns to the idea of the Corinthians seeking out the more desirable gifts -- <b>cf. v. 1.</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To begin he compares and contrasts the gifts of prophecy and speaking in tongues.  It is 
				obvious from the outset that Paul prefers the gift of prophecy and values it more than the gift of tongues.  This may seem a little unfair 
				when we remember that Paul already said that the Holy Spirit determines who gets what.  If that is so and we have no say in it and we are 
				all part of the same body, then shouldn't all gifts be valued the same?  However Paul's <i>reason</i> for emphasizing prophecy and devaluing 
				tongues explains a lot -- <b>cf. vv. 2-5.</b>  Paul's concern above all else is that the church be edified through the exercise of spiritual 
				gifts.  This desire is in accordance with chapter thirteen's emphasis on love because it seeks the best interest of others.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul elaborates on this theme a good bit in <b>vv. 6-19.</b>  The key issue seems to be 
				understanding.  It was possible for edification to happen with tongues <b><i>if</i></b> an interpreter was present to explain what was being 
				said (although how cumbersome that can be).  But with prophecy which was spoken in an understandable language, there would always be 
				understanding (without the interruptions).  We'll come back to some of these verses as we look at some of the specific questions about tongues 
				later.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The need for Paul's instruction about this is caused by the Corinthian's immaturity and lack 
				of understanding -- <b>cf. v. 20.</b>  They apparently had overvalued and glorified the gift of tongues.  Why?  Perhaps because it was more 
				'showy'?  This idea fits within the scope of Paul's teaching and concern.  That sort of selfish seeking for attention was exactly what he has 
				been trying to correct -- <b>cf. v. 4.</b>  Paul continues by revealing that the purpose of the gift of tongues was  <i>'for a sign.'</i>  
				This, too, we will revisit and discuss at length.  For now it is sufficient to understand that, again, while edification for the church was 
				<i>possible</i> through tongues, this was not the main purpose of the gift.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The immaturity and ignorance of the Corinthians was causing trouble in the church.  What 
				sort of trouble was it causing?  Apparently it was creating disorder and confusion in their worship services -- <b>cf. vv. 33, 40.</b>  How 
				so?  Some scholars think that when the people of the church came together there was sort of a competition to see who would be able to speak 
				or share their gift, maybe more to the point, to have the spotlight -- <b>cf. 26-31.</b>  This <i>'spirit of rivalry'</i> as Robert Picirilli 
				calls it (<i>I &II Corinthians</i>, Randall House Commentary, p. 205)  can be seen earlier in the book as factions debate about who they 
				prefer as their leaders (<b>cf. 1:11-13</b>).  Remember, the main purpose of Paul's letter was to address questions and confront problems 
				of the church at Corinth.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notice that there were others besides those with the gift of tongues which were contributing 
				to the problem.  The general lack of maturity was shared by others as well.  So much more the need for them to hear and heed God's word
				-- <b>cf. v. 39.</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will conclude this segment by noting two things.  One is to recognize how little good 
				Paul had to say about exercising the gift of tongues in public worship services.  The second is how closely the disorderly worship services 
				Paul is trying to correct in his day resembles what happens in so many worship services today which similarly emphasize speaking in tongues 
				and other sign gifts.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next we will begin looking at specific questions and try to find our answers in Scripture 
				to help us in our understanding of this controversial issue.</font></p>

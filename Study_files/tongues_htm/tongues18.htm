			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the previous segment, we were talking about the final category of spiritual gifts, namely, 
				those gifts which were intended to be for <b><i>signs</i></b>.  We have already examined those we have labeled as <i>permanent</i> and 
				<i>temporary</i> and presented our reasons for doing so in previous segments.  To refresh our memory about this last group, recall that 
					<i>sign</i> gifts were defined as those which had a primary purpose of attracting attention and, in general, validating the new faith 
					in Jesus as God's one true way to Himself.  These gifts were well suited to do this because they involved a direct and overt manifestation 
					of supernatural power easily observed in instantaneous healings, unexplainable miracles, and someone speaking in a previously unknown (to 
					the speaker himself) language.  Remember also that speaking in tongues was specifically categorized as one of these sign gifts in <b>Mark 16:17</b> 
					and <b>I Corinthians 14:22.</b>  To further refresh, recall also that the latter reference by Paul seems to narrow the scope of the gift 
					of tongues as a sign to unbelieving Jews by relating it to Old Testament prophecy (<b>cf. I Corinthians 14:20-21</b>).  In other words it 
					had little to do with Gentiles.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now an immediate reaction from the charismatic continuationist will undoubtedly be that if it 
				had so little to do with Gentiles, as I say, then why did there seem to be so many Gentiles in the church in Corinth who had it and practiced it?  
				My first response to that would be that we do not know for sure what sorts of people constituted the Corinthian church.  Just because it was a 
				Greco-Roman city does not mean that there were no Jews who were part of it -- there could have been many.  Remember this was still very early 
				in church history and Jews were predominant or at least as numerous in many churches as Gentiles.  So it could have been that there were many 
				Jews in the church who had this gift as a means of demonstrating the validity of faith in Jesus to other Jews yet in unbelief.  <b>Or</b> perhaps 
				there were only a few Jews in the church (relatively speaking) but <b>all</b> of them had the gift because there were many Jews yet to be evangelized.  
				In any case there were enough trying to exercise the gift that it disrupted the services.  But let me also state for the record that I am not trying 
				to suggest that no Gentiles ever received the gift of tongues.  Obviously some did -- <b>cf. Acts 10:46.</b>  But even then it seemed to signify more 
				to Peter and the other Jews present than it did to the Gentiles who were doing it -- <b>cf. 44-45, 47.</b>  Remember it wasn't the existence of the 
				gift which was causing problems in Corinth, it was the <b>misuse</b> of the gift.  As we submitted earlier, when the gift was used appropriately as a 
				sign to the Jews, then the foreign languages <i>themselves</i> sufficed because the sign pointed to looming judgment.  But when the gift was twisted 
				into use in a church setting then an interpreter was required so that any resulting confusion might be eliminated.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No doubt my use of the word 'twisted' in the previous sentence may seem strong.  But this leads to 
				my second response to the (anticipated) charismatic reaction, that is, just because the gift was exercised in church services does not mean it 
				really belonged there.  We have already noted that <b>I Corinthians 12-14</b> was, by and large, written by Paul as damage control with regard to 
				the practice of tongues in the church.  To this point, Robert Picirilli has a very insightful paragraph in his 2009 paper, <i>Is the Gift of Tongues 
				for Today?</i> (p. 11) which I want to share here:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<i>In conclusion to this exegetical survey, I may note that the evaluation of tongues in 1 Corinthians 14 is generally negative, with little 
							more than a few positive concessions scattered here and there -- and this at a time when the gift was definitely given!  Those concessions 
							are as follows.
							<ul>
								<li>
									Verse 2: with tongues one speaks to God in the form of mysteries, but in prophecy one speaks to others for edification and this 
									is why you should seek to prophesy.
								</li>
								<li>
									Verse 4: with tongues one edifies himself, but in prophecy one edifies others.
								</li>
								<li>
									Verse 5: I would that you all spoke in tongues, but I would rather that you prophesied.
								</li>
								<li>
									Verse 14: when I pray in tongues my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful, so my decision is to pray in such a way that 
									both are fruitfully involved.
								</li>
								<li>
									Verse 17: with tongues you give thanks well, but the other person is not edified.
								</li>
								<li>
									Verses 18-19: I speak in tongues more than all of you, yet in the church I would rather speak five words in our common language than 
									10,000 otherwise.
								</li>
							</ul>
							In other words, every positive thing said about tongues is a concession followed immediately by a “but” that contrasts a larger good.  I 
							find it difficult to glean, from this chapter, any real encouragement to speak in tongues.</i></p>

				</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It goes back to the expressed purpose of spiritual gifts in <b>I Corinthians 12:7</b> which is that 
				they are meant for the <i>"profit of all."</i>  And I believe that was definitely true.  Yet certain gifts were not as profitable in certain contexts 
				as others.  The gift of tongues was much more profitable in a gathering of unbelieving Jews than in a church setting where people already believed in 
				Jesus.  Yes, it is true, as we have already conceded in a previous segment, that if someone in church spoke in a tongue a message from God <b>and</b> 
				someone there could interpret it then edification could be accomplished.  Therefore Paul did not forbid it.  But it would be unwieldy and cumbersome.  
				Why not simply prophecy instead as Paul encouraged them to do (<b>cf. I Cor. 14:39</b>)?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our <b>current pertinent</b> question is: <i>"Is the gift of tongues for today?"</i>  We obviously think the 
				<i>permanent</i> gifts are.  Likewise <i>temporary</i> gifts were not.  But what about the <i>sign</i> gifts (including tongues)?  Were they meant to continue 
				or did they cease?  That is what we'll look at in the next segment.  (You can probably find a clue in what I think by the tense I used in the prior 
				paragraph.)</font></p>

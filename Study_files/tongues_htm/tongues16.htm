		<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the previous segment, we defined, delineated and discussed <i>temporary</i> gifts, especially 
				focusing on prophecy the way many modern charismatics view it. I want to follow up on that just a bit before moving on to the <i>sign</i> gifts.  
				We saw before that (some) charismatics have a lower opinion of New Testament prophecy (i.e., it is more of a feeling or a prompting than a direct, 
				definitive message) and allow that at times a true prophet can be mistaken.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the arguments is that this is why the gift of <i>discerning spirits</i> was given, so that 
				a prophecy given could be examined and the truth sorted out from any false message.  They also say that the need for such evaluation, in and of itself, 
				distinguishes the New Testament style of prophecy from the Old Testament brand.  Why?  Because, they claim, there was never such an evaluation of 
				prophecy in the Old Testament.  However, they are wrong about that.  There was a couple of very strong requirements given by God concerning His prophets 
				which, at the same time, was left to the people to evaluate -- <b>cf. Deuteronomy 13:1-5; 18:21-22.</b>  So if the people detected that the prophet was 
				trying to move them away from the Lord to worship false gods or if whatever he foretold did not come to pass they could confidently classify him as a 
				false prophet.  And, by the way, these passages are likely instructive regarding the real role of the gift of discerning spirits.  In other words that 
				gift was probably more about discerning whether the <b>speaker</b> was true or false as a prophet rather than trying to figure out which parts of the 
				message were really from God.  It is a little "suspicious," as Picirilli puts it, to have to parse out a message which allegedly originated from the Holy 
				Spirit.  Why wouldn't all of it be true if the speaker was a real prophet speaking the word and will of God?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It may be overly cynical on my part but it seems to me that the only reason this dumbing down of 
				prophecy is occurring is so that today's "prophets" can claim the title without ultimately being held accountable for the words they speak (and, no I'm 
				not suggesting they should be stoned).  I am reminded of a "prophecy" Pat Robertson made a few years ago in which he stated that <i>"If I am hearing the 
				Lord right..."</i> then a significant tsunami was going to strike the Pacific Northwest coastline in that year.  I'm not sure if Pat's ears were clogged 
				with wax or maybe God was mumbling (not!) but nothing of the sort happened that year.  Nevertheless he had given himself an out with those who have a low 
				view of prophecy.  The point here is that true prophets of God didn't qualify their statements like that and then just hope like crazy that it came true.  
				Real prophets heard God's voice clearly and spoke what they heard Him say.  It was always one hundred percent correct.  It was always in accordance with 
				His other revealed truth.  Today's "prophets" do not meet these standards.  But that's okay because we already have God's full revelation as given in His 
				creation, and in the Bible and in the incarnation of Jesus Christ.  Everything we need to know about God Himself and God's will for us as His creation is 
				right there.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One other quick note (and again I am indebted to Robert Picirilli's 2009 paper <i>"Is the Gift of Tongues 
				for Today?"</i> for this thought) regarding this low view of prophecy is the argument that in the New Testament one could decide to disobey the prophet -- 
				<b>cf. Acts 20:22-24; 21:4, 10-14.</b>  But reading carefully one notes that Paul did not disobey the prophet but only the wishes of those who heard what 
				the prophet said and did not want Paul to continue to such a fate.  In other words the prophet was correct in what he said about Paul's fate but nowhere 
				is Paul commanded by him to not go.  <b>V. 4</b> seems to imply that some disciples had the authority of the Spirit to tell him not to go.  Yet Paul the 
				<b><u>Apostle</u></b> is convinced that he is doing God's will.  So it seems a better way to read it is that the disciples found out through the Spirit 
				what was about to happen and tried to talk Paul out of going as in <b>v. 12.</b>  Bottom line here is that this passage does not prove that New Testament 
				prophecy is of a different and inferior character to Old Testament prophecy.</font></p>

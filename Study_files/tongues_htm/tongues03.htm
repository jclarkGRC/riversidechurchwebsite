			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Further History</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In beginning a brief look at the history of the modern phenomenon of speaking in tongues, we saw 
				that, in the twenty centuries of the church age, the instances of groups appearing which claim to possess the gift of tongues speaking go 
				all the way back to the second century but are, nevertheless, relatively rare.  We concluded by noting that the roots of what we are seeing 
				today began in the very first part of the twentieth century with what became the Pentecostal movement.  Many refer to this as the <i>first wave</i>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Around 1960 the <i>second wave</i> began.  In this era, Pentecostalism went far beyond the limits of 
				its traditional domains.  Other denominations and groups began to experience in their midst the appearance of <i>the charismatic gifts of the Spirit</i>, 
				as they were now beginning to be called.  Almost every denomination was affected-- Roman Catholic, mainline reformed Protestant, evangelical, 
				liberal, conservative--it did not matter.  Groups like the <i>Full Gospel Business Men’s Fellowship International</i>, which operated beyond 
				denominational boundaries, acted as conduits to spread the phenomena.  The second wave maintained the teaching  that the baptism of the 
				Holy Spirit was to be sought by the individual believer and that the successful acquisition was signified by the ability to speak in tongues.  
				There was a great fervor for ecumenism and proselytism.  Non-Pentecostal churches and denominations were forced to respond.  It was in this 
				atmosphere that Free Will Baptists passed a 1973 resolution and adopted the Appendix to Chapter VII of our <i>Treatise</i> on p. 18 in July, 1979.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several issues are addressed in the adopted Appendix statement.  Free Will Baptists 
				have maintained that the 'tongues' spoken by the believers there on the Day of Pentecost in Acts 2 were distinct human languages, not a 
				mysterious unknown tongue (<b>cf. Acts 2:5-11</b>). We have also always denied that New Testament speaking in tongues was the visible sign of the 
				baptism of the Holy Spirit.  Nor do we believe that the Bible teaches that all should speak in tongues (<b>cf. I Cor. 12:4-13</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will address some of these passages in more depth and detail at a later point in the study.  
				For now we just want to note the main differences between Free Will Baptist teachings and that of the 'first' and 'second' wave of Pentecostalism 
				concerning speaking in tongues.  I might also note that the Free Will Baptist approach is, in general, representative of the non-charismatic 
				Christian community.</font></p>

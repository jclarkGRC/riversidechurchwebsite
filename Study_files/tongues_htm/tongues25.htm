			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 16</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the previous segment we were continuing our comparison between New Testament speaking 
				in tongues and what is happening today.  We saw then that the general atmosphere in many (most?) of the churches practicing tongues seems to 
				be disorderly and chaotic according to the testimony of those who have attended such.  That sort of atmosphere is in direct contradiction to 
				Paul's instructions in <b>I Corinthians 14.</b>    We also debunked the idea that those of us who do not practice 'tongues' have somehow 
				quenched the Holy Spirit's work in us and His will for us because we have not actively sought that gift.  Scriptures do not command us to seek 
				it nor do we see examples of anyone seeking it, even those to whom it was clearly given.  Further I have spoken to those who felt like they 
				needed to seek it and did so by praying and asking God to bring it to them.  But He did not in some cases.  How does this square with the idea 
				of some charismatics that it is God's will for <b>all</b> believers to experience the Spirit's fullness through tongues?  It does not.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another corollary to this is how <b>Acts 2:2-4</b> describes the way that first group on the 
				day of Pentecost seemed to be overwhelmed by the Spirit.  Thus what is implied sometimes from this is that the gift of tongues and some of the 
				other charismatic goings on (like holy laughter, rolling on the floor, falling down and becoming stiff as a board, etc. which we have not 
				addressed because there is no biblical basis for them <b>whatsoever</b>) are things completely controlled by the Holy Spirit and when He 
				decides to move that way, a person is overwhelmed and controlled by that manifestation of power in that moment.  The person cannot help but 
				do it.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But is that true? I would not presume to dogmatically state what the Day of Pentecost 
				looked like nor what sort of control those affected had or did not have.  It would seem to have been a profoundly powerful experience.  Could 
				they have resisted the impulse to speak in tongues at that moment?  That is somewhat of a moot question because the event was of God and served 
				His purposes, and they were genuine believers in accord with God and each other.  In other words, they were willing to be used as instruments 
				of His plans and so they had no reason nor any inclination to resist what God sent to them.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, having said all that, I do believe that they did have to ability to not continue 
				speaking.  Or perhaps a better way to put it, is that when the time came to be quiet they did not continue to speak out in these foreign 
				languages as if they could not control themselves.  What is the proof of that?  Well, in <b>v. 14</b> Peter and the other Apostles stand and 
				he (Peter) begins to preach to the crowd.  He had to speak up because we see later in <b>v. 41</b> that there were at least 3000 people listening.  
				It is hard for me to imagine that as he preached the others were running around speaking out in tongues and creating a disturbance and being a 
				distraction.  I am inclined to think that when Peter started speaking the others got quiet so he could be heard by the crowd.  Is it absolutely 
				certain I am right about this?  No, because I was not there.  But it seems to be a very reasonable assumption.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More importantly it is also in accord with what Paul says to the Corinthians in <b>chapter 14</b>:
				<ul>
					<li>
						27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret. 
					</li>
					<li>
						28 But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				Paul fully expects that there will be times in the Corinthian church services where several will want to speak in tongues.  But he puts limitations 
				on the number of speakers.  This meant that any others beyond two or three had to keep quiet.  This obviously means that they <b>could decide</b> to 
				<b>not</b> allow their mouths to fly open and emit foreign languages which they did not understand themselves.  Further if no one with the gift of 
				interpreting such foreign languages was present then <b>none</b> were allowed to exercise this gift.  Again this strongly presumes that such gifts 
				were under the control of the one having the gift.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And in point of fact Paul makes this exact statement about another speaking gift:
				<ul>
					<li>
						29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge. 
					</li>
					<li>
						30 But if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent. 
					</li>
					<li>
						31 For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged. 
					</li>
					<li>
						32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				Though he greatly prefers prophecy to tongues, Paul puts similar restrictions on the number of prophets who should share in a given service.  Any who 
				were not given a turn in a given service were to keep quiet and wait until another time.  This way things were not disorderly and it kept the services 
				to a reasonable amount of time so they did not all become discouraged. This was possible because the prophets had control over the spirit of prophecy 
				within them.  In other words it does not seem that if they received a prophecy they were then therefore compelled to speak.  They had the ability to 
				remain silent.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though Paul did not make this exact statement as he gave instructions about tongues in the preceding 
				verses, it seems reasonable to apply this principle to the other speaking gifts, indeed, to <b>all</b> spiritual gifts.  Anyone who has a particular 
				spiritual gift usually derives satisfaction from exercising it, whatever it may be -- teaching, giving, evangelizing, helping, administration and so on.  
				But they also should have or should develop discernment about what constitutes an appropriate time to employ their gift.  For instance, I love to teach 
				but if I try to teach someone who has no interest in my subject matter, I do little or no good and perhaps do harm.  Just so, some people don't want or 
				need to be evangelized.  Some people don't want or need to be helped.  You get the point.  Paul is essentially telling the church in Corinth that the way 
				they are doing worship is, in fact, counterproductive because it was out of control.  He is urging them to wisely and maturely restrain themselves and 
				regain control so all can be edified, not just the self-centered ones.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All this contradicts those modern charismatics who claim that speaking in tongues and those other 
				"manifestations" of the Spirit cannot be helped or controlled.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Biblical Passages - 2</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having started looking at the passages in the Bible which address the spiritual gift of 
				'speaking in tongues', we examined Mark 16:14-20 and found that it does little more than announce the coming appearance of '<i>new tongues</i>' 
				and some other sign gifts.  Nevertheless I think we gleaned some useful information from the Greek words used and from the text itself.  
				In a way it laid a foundation for what we will find in the other passages.  So let's move on to those.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Without a doubt <b>Acts 2:1-21</b> relates the best known single occurrence of people 
				speaking in tongues.  This is very appropriate since it is also the occasion which marks the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon God's 
				people which Jesus promised in <b>Acts 1:4-8</b>.  There are some differences of opinion about what was actually happening there so let's 
				review it and try to discover what the reality was.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already seen that the word '<i>glossa</i>' used in vv. 4, 11 and translated 
				'<i>tongues</i>' is simply the common Greek reference to languages.  So the initial natural conclusion to be drawn just from that fact is 
				that the '<i>tongues</i>' the disciples were speaking were actual languages.  In this view, the word '<i>other</i>' (root <i>heteros</i>) 
				refers to human languages which the disciples had not studied nor known previously.  That was the miracle.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now the 'first and second waves ' of Pentecostalism, which we saw earlier, claim the 
				ability to speak in tongues as on the day of Pentecost (hence, the name).  <i>But</i> they also believe that what they are doing is not 
				necessarily in a human language but in a heavenly language which only God and the angels know.  Thus they use the word '<i>other</i>' in 
				an extreme way (just as they use the word '<i>new</i>' in <b>Mark 16:17</b>), that is, they take it to mean something completely outside 
				the realm of human knowing rather than just outside one person's knowledge.  But this seems a bit contradictory.  If it is not human languages 
				one is speaking then is he really reproducing Pentecost?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a bit of a problem for Pentecostals because of the clarity of <b>Acts 2</b> on this 
				matter.  We do not have to rely on the common usage of '<i>glossa</i>' alone for our understanding about this.  Ronald Baxter points out that 
				there is another word used in vv. 6, 8 which is even more precise.  In his <i>Charismatic Gift of Tongues</i> he cites  Lewis Johnson 
				who writes: </font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The word</i> dialektos <i>occurs about six times in Acts, and in each occurrence 
				it refers to a known language or dialect.  In other words, the sense of a known tongue in 2:4 is made definite by the description of this 
				phenomenon as a speaking in dialektos in verses 6, 8.  (p. 4)</i></font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But wait, there's more!  There is a specific listing in vv. 9-11 of all the languages which 
				these foreign born Jews were hearing .  Why were all these Jews from other nations in Jerusalem?  They had made the journey to keep the Jewish 
				festival of Pentecost.  (But I'm sure it's just a coincidence that God chose that day for the coming of the Holy Spirit--tongue planted firmly 
				in cheek here).  It seems that God really made an effort to let us know that these were actual human languages and not some mysterious 
				otherworldly language (no, not Klingon). Speaking to this, Robert Picirilli observes:</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>That is the very point of the record; only an unnatural interpretation can suggest 
					any other conclusion. ... The very purpose of this information is to impress us with the variety of languages spoken by those who gathered 
					at Pentecost. (What the Bible Says about Tongues, p. 6.)</i></font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those who favor the idea that what was being vocalized was something other than a normal 
				human language sometimes point to the mockers in v. 13.  The theory is that what they were saying was unintelligible and sounded like the 
				mutterings of a drunkard.  There is little appeal to this notion.  Two thoughts: 1)  If it was me, I don' t think I would be so keen to compare 
				my own practice (sometimes referred to as 'ecstatic utterances') to the musings of the inebriated.  But that's just me... ;  2)  It ignores the 
				fact that their speech was comprehensible to the foreign born Jews.  Clearly there were two groups.  One understood the tongues speaking and were 
				amazed and one did not and jumped to a bad conclusion about the disciples.  What was the difference?  I like Baxter's approach to the 
				issue:</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>However note the distinction made here by the use of others</i> [in v. 13]... <i>It refers 
					to a generic distinction.  These mockers were other than the non-Palestinian Jews mentioned previously. They were the Palestinian Jews whom 
					Peter begins to address in verse 14.  To them the other languages were a babble of unfamiliar sounds.  Thus, the only conclusion they could 
					find to explain the excitement and amazement produced upon those who did understand was that they were being disturbed by drunk men.  
					(Charismatic Gift of Tongues, p. 5.)</i></font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One other note about this passage worth mentioning is the contention by some that the miracle 
				is not about the ones speaking but, rather, it is about the ones listening.  In other words, it did not matter what were the actual sounds coming 
				the speakers because the Holy Spirit caused people to hear what He desired.  So it <i>could</i> have been 'ecstatic utterances' or an angelic 
				language.  Picirilli responds to this:</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Some interpreters attempt to make this a miracle of hearing, saying the people heard in 
					languages not being spoken at all.  But surely the phrase "in our tongues" (2:11) modifies "speak," not "hear."  Likewise 2:6.  I doubt that 
					such a strange interpretation of the record would ever have been thought of had there not been a need to justify some kind of "tongues" other 
					than real languages.  (What the Bible Says about Tongues, p. 7.)</i></font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We'll come back to this when we consider the stated purpose of 'tongues.'  For now, I might also 
				ask, "If it was a miracle of hearing, and not of speaking, then why didn't <i>all</i> the men present understand?"  And I might also add that it 
				<i>is</i> called the gift of 'tongues,' <b><i>not</i></b> the gift of 'ears.'  We will next take a look at the other passages in Acts.</font></p>

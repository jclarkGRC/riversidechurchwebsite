			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 8</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have concluded looking at what are sometimes called the <i>temporary</i> gifts, that is, those 
				gifts which had a practical and needed purpose in the early church but due to later developments became unnecessary.  It may be noted in the list I 
				gave which specified such gifts that they were all, with one exception, speaking gifts involving prophetical utterance.  So, as I have previously 
				submitted, these particular gifts were superseded by the completion of the New Testament.  In other words, the church at large and/or local churches 
				no longer needed prophecy (i.e., direct divine revelation to individuals which was to be shared with other believers) because it now had God's full 
				message in the Bible.  Nor did it need to discern whether those who gave such messages were true or false, and so on.  These gifts were given as 
				temporary tools to help in the transition of the early church.  It makes sense, then, that when they were no longer necessary, the Holy Spirit would 
				cease giving them.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The lone exception (at least in my list of temporary gifts) mentioned above is the gift/office of 
				being an <b>apostle (cf. Acts 4:11).</b>  I have reserved discussing this particular gift until now because it is linked very strongly with our final 
				category of gifts, namely the <i>sign</i> gifts.  Sign gifts, as I am defining them, were those which had a primary purpose of attracting attention and, 
				in general, validating the new faith in Jesus as God's one true way to Himself.  These gifts were suited to do this because they involved a direct and 
				overt manifestation of divine power.  Most who take this approach would say that tongues, healings, miracles and probably the interpretation of tongues 
				(cf. Paul's lists in <b>I Corinthians 12:4-10, 28-30</b>) all fall into this category (there is actually no question about tongues falling into this 
				category per <b>Mark 16:17</b> and <b>I Corinthians 14:22</b>).  So while the miraculous event in and of itself might have some practical effect for 
				good in the lives it affected, the <b>primary</b> design was to demonstrate God's power to unbelievers.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take <b>Acts 3:1-12ff; 4:4</b> for example.  In the passage the lame man is helped -- of that there is 
				no doubt.  But did God work the miracle through Peter for that reason alone?  Or was it rather to provide a verifiable, unassailable foundation for 
				Peter's sermon to those in the temple so that 5000 might be saved?  I submit that it was much more the latter reason than the former.  This in fact is, 
				I believe, the pattern for all God's miraculous interventions into the lives of men.  Good things happen in the lives of individuals when the Lord 
				overrules the natural course of events but ultimately the purpose is to help create, establish and confirm faith in the lives of multitudes.  In other 
				words, there is a bigger picture and a larger purpose for signs and miracles than just making one person's or a few people's lives easier. May I 
				digress for a moment and mention that one of the problems I have with continuationists is the self-centered approach many of them have toward the 
				Christian faith?  If you read or listen to their message, you will often find a strong <i>"It's all about me"</i> mentality.  In other words, 
				according to them, it's always God's will that we be happy, healthy and wealthy.  And, furthermore, if we are not so, then it must be that we simply 
				do not have enough faith for God to be able to bless us the way He wants.  I reject that approach and mindset toward faith in God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does that mean I think Christians should never ask God for personal needs or desires?  Of course 
				not.  Jesus instructed us to depend on God for our needs in His lesson to the Twelve about how to pray.  And I do believe God wants to bless us and 
				wants us to enjoy what's good in this life.  But we must also recognize that there are bigger things at stake than whether I am having a good day, 
				or I am personally "fulfilled" at my job, or I am in good health, or even whether I have enough to eat at the moment.  The issue here is not about 
				<i>what</i> we ask from God so much as <i>why</i> we ask for it -- <b>cf. James 4:1-3.</b>  Even asking for our daily food may be done for a higher 
				motive -- <b>cf. Proverbs 30:7-9.</b>  You see, the bigger question here is:  <i>"When I make my requests known to God, am I willing to defer them, 
				submit to His will, take "No" for an answer, and understand that it is not all about me?"</i>  The Christian faith, at least here on this earth, is 
				not about, as Napoleon and Pedro said, having <i>"all your wildest dreams come true."</i>  Rather, it is about service and self-sacrifice.  It is 
				about following the example of Jesus who denied Himself so that others might have life more abundant.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, the self-centeredness described above is not limited to continuationists nor to the 
				"Name it-claim it" crowd, the "signs and wonders" or the charismatic movement in general.  I fear that many Christians, no matter what the stripe or 
				label, have bought into the idea that Christianity is about "me getting what I need and want from God."  Some of that is to be expected because our 
				own experiences and circumstances (and those closest to us) affect us deeply.  It is natural we should be concerned with those sorts of matters.  
				(And I myself am certainly no exception.)  I am not suggesting that we stop praying for the things which concern us most.  Seeking God's intervention 
				is always a good thing.  It draws us to Him.  It helps us recognize our dependency on Him.  It gives Him a chance to demonstrate His love, concern and 
				power for us so that we may then glorify His name to others.  All this can happen even when my original motive is not the highest and best.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And while all (or maybe I should say "most") Christians struggle with that tension between asking God 
				for the greater good and asking for our own wants, I still think that the "It's all about me" way of thinking is more 'institutionalized,' so to speak, 
				in those groups which affirm that "You can have a miracle from God today."</font></p>

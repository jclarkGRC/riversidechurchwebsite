			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Brief History</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The controversy in the Christian community over charismatic tongues and 
				other phenomena dates all the way back to the second century.   Ronald Baxter in his book <i>Charismatic Gift of Tongues</i> (pp. 111-13) 
				relates that in AD 150 Montanus claimed to be a prophet and to possess such gifts.  According to Earle Cairns in his <i>Christianity 
				Through the Centuries</i> (p. 102), Montanus was originally concerned with formalism in the church and the rise of the status of the 
				clergy but his reaction developed into such an extreme position that it was eventually condemned as heresy and was labeled <i>Montanism</i>.  
				Philip Schaff in <i>History of the Christian Church</i> (vol. 2, p. 417) expresses doubt that it should be seen as heresy but says rather it 
				was <i>‘overstraining’</i> and <i>‘excessive’</i> but for the most part orthodox in doctrine.  Nevertheless, Montanus, along with two women named 
				Maximilla and Priscilla (who, according to Baxter, had both abandoned their husbands to follow Montanus) began to teach in the region 
				of Phrygia.  They gained great notoriety and influence (several sources say the women especially were exalted by their followers 
				almost even to a place of preeminence over Jesus) to the point that Tertullian, an early church father, bishop of Carthage and 
				acclaimed as a great apologist, eventually joined them around AD 200.  The main point of contention between Montanists and the 
				mainstream church was whether the same sort of inspiration which produced the New Testament writings continued or not.  Montanus 
				said it did and further claimed that he himself possessed it (as noted he was eventually labeled a heretic as a result).  The 
				other manifestations, such as speaking in tongues, played a secondary role but nonetheless contributed to the strife.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point is to show all this is not new, though it was somewhat rare.  
				According to John F. MacArthur, Jr., (<i>Charismatic Chaos</i>, pp. 285-86)  there was no other significant outbreak of tongues until the 
				seventeenth century:  among some French protestants sometimes called the Cevennol prophets; and some Roman Catholics known as the 
				Jansenists; and, in America, Mother Ann Lee's group, known as the Shakers.  One other group appeared in the early nineteenth century, 
				sometimes referred to as Irvingites after Scottish Presbyterian pastor Edward Irving.  All these groups, as the Montanists, are usually 
				characterized as unorthodox, fanatical and/or heretical.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the current confusion and disagreement has its roots in the early twentieth 
				century.  In 1900 Charles Parham taught and led Christian meetings and schools in Topeka and in Kansas City in which members began to 
				speak in tongues.  In 1906 on Azusa Street in Los Angeles was a mission in which the same phenomenon broke out.  It was from these events 
				that many <i>Pentecostal</i> groups we see today first emerged and later developed (e.g. the Foursquare Gospel churches,  Assemblies of God, various 
				Pentecostal churches and Churches of God).  For the first fifty years or so, the movement, and its belief that the required baptism of the 
				Holy Spirit is necessarily evidenced by speaking in tongues stayed, as Robert Picirilli (<i>What the Bible Says About Tongues</i>, p. 2) puts it, 
				<i>‘more or less within the confines of [those] particular denominations.’</i>  This is often referred to as the <i>first wave</i> of Pentecostalism.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will next take a look at the <i>second</i> and <i>third waves</i> of the Pentecostal movement which has 
				had a much wider impact on the rest of Christianity.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 15</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the previous segment we began evaluating what is really happening in today's churches in 
				which the members claim to possess the gift of speaking in tongues.  Having reviewed what we found in the Bible about tongues we began comparing 
				what it said to today's practice.  We saw that though the New Testament gift involved real, understandable, translatable human languages, today's 
				variety does not do so.  We also saw that New Testament tongues served as an important sign to Jews and also helped confirm who the real Apostles 
				were. But today's charismatics have no true purpose for their practice which can be viably supported in the Scriptures.  So far then what we have 
				seen is that the modern practice falls far short of what was happening in the first century of the life of the church.  </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To continue let's consider the atmosphere in many of the churches which accept and affirm today's 
				version of speaking in tongues.  Before I go on let me first disclose that I myself have never attended a charismatic service.  I have heard and 
				read testimony from those who have attended and I have watched it some on Christian television.  Second let me say that I am not applying what 
				follows to <b>every</b> church which affirms speaking in tongues.  I am confident that there are some pastors and churches which are endeavoring 
				to follow Paul's instructions about restraint in <b>I Corinthians 14</b> as they allow the "gift" to be practiced.  I appreciate that attitude 
				though I continue to think that they are sincerely mistaken in allowing it to occur to begin with.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why do I say that?  First, because what we have learned in the passages we have examined seem to 
				be strongly opposed to what they are doing.  This is evidenced by the fact that, from what I have seen and heard described, the general atmosphere 
				of such churches begins to deteriorate into disorderliness.  Some are no doubt worse than others.  The worst of them seem to resemble a three ring 
				circus in which several things are happening all at once and one must choose where to place his attention.  It is chaotic and, frankly, a little 
				frightening at times according to people who have experienced it.  That sort of atmosphere is in direct contradiction to what Paul instructs in 
				<b>I Corinthians 14 (cf. especially vv. 23, 26-27, 31, 40).</b>  I have heard that some in charismatic circles actually use this chapter to show 
				that what is happening in their services is proper because it describes a New Testament church service.  If so, then they have not seriously read 
				the chapter nor detected the tone as reflected in Paul's words and instructions.  They have not realized that Paul is admonishing and trying to 
				change what is happening in the Corinthian church services and he is certainly not praising or affirming it!  In other words, they are completely 
				ignoring the context of the passage.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know that one possible charismatic response and objection to these statements might be that my 
				attitude constrains or restrains the work of the Spirit.  How can any human decide for someone else what he should do to worship the Lord?  If the 
				Spirit moves a person then that person must not quench the Spirit (<b>cf. I Thess. 5:19</b>). And, they would say, that is probably the reason a 
				person like me has never experienced such workings from the Spirit.  I have never sought them.  I do not desire them therefore the Spirit cannot 
				manifest His full power in me.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will absolutely confess that I, as an imperfect human being, have grieved and quenched the Spirit 
				on a number of occasions.  I have, at times, not done what He wanted me to do, and at other times, done exactly what He would have me not do. I have 
				no doubt impeded His will for me because of my sin.  I need His grace and mercy.  Further, let me state that I do not have any desire to dictate to 
				an <i>individual</i> what he or she does to worship God in private.  I think that they should certainly not go beyond what Scripture mandates but, in 
				those gray areas, I agree charity and liberty should be exercised. <b>But</b> we are not talking about private worship.  Our concern, as Paul's was, 
				is the public worship of the church and the effect that bad and wrong practices have on the members and any guests who might attend.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, back to the objection, is it correct to say that I do not have the gift of tongues because I 
				have never sought it?  Some charismatics point to <b>I Corinthians 12:31</b> as proof that it is.  But the latter part of the verse lauding a better 
				approach to serving God, i.e. love, and then <b>14:1-5ff</b> make it clear that Paul is excluding tongues from the category of <b><i>best gifts.</i></b>  
				The best gifts edify others but tongues was being used by the Corinthians to edify themselves.  And furthermore, charismatics cannot show one place 
				in the New Testament where a person <i>sought</i> the gift of tongues.  Were the ones on the day of Pentecost seeking the gift of tongues?  No, we 
				are not told that.  We are not even told that they were praying.  They were simply together in agreement and God sent the Spirit.  Did Cornelius and 
				his household seek the gift of tongues?  This is even more unlikely. They probably had no knowledge at all of the gift of tongues. Did the disciples 
				of John in <b>Acts 19</b> seek the gift of tongues?  Again, no, we are not told that and it seems highly unlikely given their ignorance of the Holy 
				Spirit.  It seems therefore that the reception of the gift of tongues was unrelated to whether one was seeking it or not.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will continue in the next segment with a corollary to this when we explore how much control or 
				lack thereof a person has when they exercise what they are calling the gift of tongues or when some other "manifestation of the Holy Spirit" arises 
				in them.  I think you'll find it interesting.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 10</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have begun looking at that category of spiritual gifts we label as the 
				<i>sign</i> gifts.  As we have seen, it is clear from Scripture (<b>cf. Mark 16:17; I Corinthians 14:22</b>) that the gift of speaking in 
				tongues is part of this class.  These gifts with their overt supernatural manifestations were intended to show forth God's power and help 
				validate the new way to God through faith in Jesus Christ as the perfect sacrifice which atoned for our sin.  But the question for us now is: 
				"Are they still being given to believers by the Holy Spirit even today?"  Continuationists say, "Yes, <b>all</b> the spiritual gifts listed in 
				the Bible continue in the church today."  Cessationists say, "No, some of them (the <i>permanent</i> gifts) continue, but the speaking gifts 
				connected with prophetical utterance ceased when the New Testament was completed (aka <i>temporary</i> gifts) and, likewise, the sign gifts also 
				ceased."  Why do each of the groups take their positions?  What are their reasons?  In this segment we'll consider and critique the view of the 
				continuationist.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main argument of the continuationists seems to be that since these gifts were part of the 
				early church as revealed in the New Testament then they likewise must be valid for the church today.  In other words, continuationists insist 
				that since <b>I Corinthians 12-14</b> treats all the gifts as functioning and since this passage is given to the modern day church for guidance 
				as much as it was given to the first century church, then consequently all the gifts must be functioning today else the passage would be useless.  
				This is a simple but, nevertheless, somewhat compelling argument.  Christians, all of us, do look back (and appropriately so) to the New Testament, 
				for patterns, for precedents and for principles to help us formulate church life today.  We concede that point.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, it is incorrect to suggest that just because a passage deals with a particular issue 
				which existed in the first century automatically means that the same issue or condition will exist in perpetuity.  Is there a biblical example 
				we can use to support that last statement?  Robert Picirilli points out an example in the very same epistle, namely, <b>I Corinthians 11:2-16</b> 
				which deals extensively with a woman's head covering at church (<i>Is the Gift of Tongues for Today?</i>, p. 5).  Obviously many in today's church 
				(at least in Western culture) are no longer concerned with this particular custom.  Are we to suggest then that either: 1) We are in error and 
				women in church should immediately cover their heads if praying?; or 2)  The passage is obsolete and of no use to us so we can safely ignore it?  
				I think neither of these options is necessary nor correct.  I do not think it is necessary for cultural changes to be altered as long as they are 
				neutral in effect (all the ladies will likely say "Amen!").  And certainly it is not correct to declare any of the Bible obsolete. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To help illustrate consider another verse -- <b>Romans 16:16.</b>  Must we begin to conform to 
				this standard of greeting?  I think not (this time all the men will say "Amen!").  Yet the principle of sincere, warm and affectionate greetings 
				between believers is certainly not obsolete.  We simply shake hands and hug for the most part.  The point is that just because a passage 
				addresses a practice that happened in the first century does not <i>always</i> mean that the same practice exists today.  <i>But</i> neither is 
				the passage less valuable to us because the principles it teaches can go beyond the specific circumstance addressed.  To wit, the overarching 
				principles of <b>I Corinthians 12-14</b> especially concern the need for believers to have humility, love and a desire to edify each other when 
				they employ their spiritual gifts.  Those principles can be easily gathered and taught today <i>even</i> if the main gift causing concern to 
				Paul at the time (namely, speaking in tongues) is no longer given by the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another primary argument often made by continuationists is to demonstrate that <b>I Corinthians 13:8-10</b> 
				does <i>not</i> establish beyond a shadow of a doubt that tongues (and, by extension, all the sign gifts) would cease in this present era.  At 
				this point I would like to quote Picirilli extensively from his already referenced paper (p. 6):
				<blockquote>
					<p><i>This is no doubt an important part of their argument, for the simple reason that many cessationists have interpreted the words of verse 8 
						(“tongues … shall cease”) to mean cease early in the present age.  Both Carson and Grudem proceed along the following lines.  The cessation 
						of tongues (v. 8) will occur when “that which is perfect” (v. 10) comes.  At present the gifts of prophecy (directly stated) and tongues 
						(clearly implied) represent what is partial (v. 9), to be done away with when perfection comes.  This will take place at the coming of Christ 
						(the </i>parousia<i>) at the end of this age.</p>
					<p>I will not attempt further development of their view of this passage since I am in fundamental agreement with them.  Carson may think -- I am 
						not sure -- that </i>all<i> non-charismatics believe that these verses point to that cessation.  If so, he is wrong.  I have never used that 
						passage in defense of the cessation of the sign gifts.  Consequently, his exegetical conclusion, that the passage does </i>not<i> prove 
						cessation, has no effect on my position.  I insisted, in my commentary, that “the point about these three gifts of the Spirit is that they 
						represent the imperfect and partial work of the Spirit in us in the present age. All such gifts are temporary, destined to be replaced by 
						something far better."  Grudem is aware that at least one cessationist agrees with him that 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 does not foretell the 
						cessation of tongues and prophecy during the present age.</p>
					<p>The point to be made, here, is simply this: just as this passage does </i>not<i> tell that any of the gifts were intended to cease during 
						the present age, </i>neither does it tell that they were meant to continue throughout the age.<i>  It is one thing to show that the verses 
						do not prove cessation.  It is quite another to show that they require continuation.  Assuredly, the perfection of the age to come will replace 
						all our present imperfections and partial experience of the things of God.  At that point </i>everything<i> characteristic of our present 
						incompleteness will be done away, including our imperfect worship, our preaching and teaching, our ministering or showing of mercy.  Paul’s 
						point is that </i>all<i> of the gifts will pass away then.  That falls very short of demonstrating that </i>some<i> of the gifts, whose purpose 
						was temporary, did not pass away even earlier.  Indeed, Carson and Grudem think that apostleship has passed from the scene, so the passage 
						allows, in their view, for the cessation of at least one of the gifts long before the second coming.  And if there are no more apostles, then 
						the apostolic era has passed and </i>we are in a different era.</p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having begun our foray into the passages about 'speaking in tongues' in the Book 
				of Acts by addressing chapter two, we will now examine the passages in chapters ten and nineteen. These two episodes are very 
				interesting and instructive.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exact date for the events recorded in <b>Acts 10</b> is not certain.  A few give 
				it a fairly early date of AD 34-35 while most put it closer to AD 40.  In any event, a couple to several years have passed since the day 
				of Pentecost.  Now God is ready to do something new and it will be difficult for the Jews to accept it so He made some preparations which 
				are laid in the first half of the chapter.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are introduced to the Roman centurion Cornelius who had apparently become dissatisfied 
				with the Roman pantheon  and was seeking truth.  In being stationed near Palestine he saw and recognized the value of the Jewish religion 
				and to the degree of his knowledge honored and worshiped the one true God.  In prayer one day he received a vision telling him to seek 
				Simon Peter.  He did so by sending a contingent to Joppa.  In the meantime God was also preparing Peter.  Peter was given a vision in which 
				the chief message was to not look down upon that which God declares clean and holy.  The timing of Peter's vision was such that as it ended 
				Cornelius' representatives showed up at the door.  Peter invited them to spend the night and the next day he went with them to see 
				Cornelius.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon arrival Cornelius explained why he had sent for Peter.  In response Peter told him 
				how God had made it clear that he should not disdain the summons from a Gentile and began telling Cornelius and his household about Jesus.  
				This is where we pick up with the gift of tongues in vv. 44-48.  Once more I will quickly note that the same Greek words for <i>speaking</i> 
				and for <i>tongues</i> are used here as in <b>Acts 2</b>. Thus I think it safe to assume we are still talking about the same gift of speaking 
				human languages previously unstudied and unknown to the speaker.  There are other similarities to the day of Pentecost event which we need to 
				note.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For one we see the same '<i>astonishment</i>' in these Jews about the Gentiles speaking 
				in tongues which was evident in the foreign born Jews with regard to the Galileans speaking in tongues (cf. Acts 2:7, 12).  Why were they 
				so amazed?  Because never before had the Holy Spirit come upon Gentiles as such.  We recognize that there were times when Gentiles became 
				followers of God but they were always required to convert to Judaism.  That was not the case in this instance.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore this event was seen in the light of Pentecost.  Ronald Baxter notes that the 
				little word <i>'also'</i> at the end of verse 45 is significant in that it connects what was happening in Cornelius home with what happened 
				at Pentecost.  If this seems a bit of a stretch, he elaborates by referring to Acts 11:15 and how Peter, having to explain to the brothers 
				in Jerusalem, went all the way back to Pentecost for his comparison.  He further points out that the implication of Peter having to go back 
				to Pentecost to explain what happened means that it was a historical event not meant to be continuing or even reproduced somewhat regularly 
				(<i>Charismatic Gift of Tongues</i>, pp. 8-9).  In the chapters subsequent to Acts 2 we see there is good deal more information given about 
					the activities of the early church in Jerusalem but nothing more about people speaking in tongues.  Why not if it is so vital to the 
					life of the Church?  One might ask why was it reproduced in this instance in chapter ten?  We will speak more of that when we see what 
					the Bible says is the purpose of the gift of tongues.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One other small item regarding this passage which was shared by E.L. Bynum in his 
				<i>Tongue...in the Light of the Bible</i> pamphlet (p. 4).  He notes that prior to receiving the gift of tongues Cornelius and his household 
				did not pray for, ask for, or even long for the gift of tongues as far as we can tell.  They were probably not even aware of the gift's existence.  
				In fact we can extend that to the entire book of Acts.  There is no record of anyone at anytime asking for the gift of tongues or the baptism of 
				the Holy Spirit.  This is a contradiction to those who claim that these are things to be sought by believers.  These last two points may be 
				considered as invalid because they are "arguments from silence."  But, as I once read, sometimes silence can be quite eloquent.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last passage for this session is <b>Acts 19:1-7</b>.  In it we see Paul discover some 
				who professed to be disciples of John.  When he asked them about receiving the Holy Spirit they claimed ignorance, which by implication means 
				they did not know about Jesus either.  Once Paul told them about Jesus, they were baptized and when Paul laid hands on them they 'spoke with 
				tongues' (same Greek words) and 'prophesied' (another gift of the Spirit).  Why did the gift of tongues manifest in this instance?  It is hard 
				to say for sure.  In his book <i>Charismatic Chaos</i> (p. 226), John MacArthur suggests, <i>"The tongues demonstrated that although they had 
					first come into their relationship with God under the Old Covenant, they were now part of the church with everyone else."</i>  There is 
					not much more to be said about this particular episode.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, it may be useful for us to note that in each of these instances of someone receiving 
				the Holy Spirit (cf. also Acts 8:14-17) and speaking in tongues there was an apostle present.  Perhaps, as Baxter suggests (<i>Charismatic Gift 
					of Tongues</i>, p. 11), we are seeing a pattern in Acts confirming that this was an apostolic prerogative.  If this is so that has serious 
					ramifications for today's charismatic movement.</font></p>

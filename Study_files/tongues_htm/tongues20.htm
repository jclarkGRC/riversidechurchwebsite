			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 11</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the prior segment we observed the differing opinions of <i>continuationists</i> and 
				<i>cessationists</i> about whether speaking in tongues (and sign gifts, in general) continue today.  We also examined the two main arguments of 
				the continuationists.  The first is that since epistles were written for the modern church as well as the early church and since these writings 
				treated the sign gifts as active then it follows they would also be active today, or else the passages would be worthless to us.  We saw a couple 
				of examples of cultural things that have changed and are no longer in existence in the modern church <b>yet</b> the passages are still valuable 
				to today's believers for the underlying principles they teach.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second argument from continuationists revolves around their refutation of <b>I Corinthians 13:8-10</b> 
				as a passage which absolutely proves that sign gifts would cease early in the church age.  The argument hinges on how one interprets the phrase 
				<i>"that which is perfect."</i>  Does it refer to the completed canon of Scripture or to the return of Christ?  Certainly either is a plausible 
				possibility.  But since it is conceded that the passage cannot be used to <i>decisively</i> disprove the existence of tongues in today's church, it 
				may seem that the continuationist has won the point.  However, as we saw, neither does the passage positively proclaim that <i>all</i> the gifts 
				would absolutely continue until the return of Christ.  Paul is downplaying the relative importance of any and all the gifts of the Spirit (which 
				<b>will</b>, <i>at some point, cease</i>) when compared to <b><i>love</i></b>, which is the first of the fruits of the Spirit (<b>cf. Gal. 5:22</b>) 
				and <i>will always</i> continue.  So while we concede that this passage from the <i>'love chapter'</i> does not require a person to believe that 
				the sign gifts ceased when the Bible was completed, we also note that neither does it require a person to accept that all the gifts must therefore 
				necessarily continue afterward.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this point, it is probably a good time to reiterate and acknowledge that there is no passage 
				which clearly delineates the expiration date <b>or</b> which plainly declares the permanency of any spiritual gift.  As I have stated earlier, 
				that truth is what allows genuine and well-meaning believers in Jesus to honestly disagree about this sensitive issue.  That is why we must consider 
				those passages and principles which surround the issue and try to make sound evaluations and decisions accordingly. So it is not enough to simply 
				attack the arguments of the continuationists and critique them as lacking in real substance.  Cessationists must also try to build a case to support 
				their view.  Is there one to be made?  I think so.  It has to do with the one spiritual gift we have not yet really examined, that of apostleship.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The vast majority of evangelical Christians today would agree (I think) that the office of an apostle 
				has passed from the scene.  In other words, there is no one whom God has installed in such an position today.  Why do we say that?  Because  we see 
				implied in <b>Acts 1:21-22</b> and clearly stated in <b>I Corinthians 9:1</b> that for someone to be called as an apostle, he had to have been 
				personally and directly associated with Jesus Himself.  That, of course, is no longer possible since Jesus has been in heaven with the Father for some 
				2000 years.  Some may argue that Jesus had already ascended when He called Saul to be the Apostle Paul but even Paul acknowledged that this was an 
				exceptional situation (<b>cf. I Corinthians 15:8</b>) which seems unlikely to be repeated.  And, in fact, even some in his day doubted his authority 
				and he did, at times, have to validate his calling.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And that brings us to an important point. Since Paul <i>was</i> an exception, how was he confirmed 
				as a genuine apostle?  In <b>II Corinthians 11-12</b> he writes an extended defense of his apostolic authority which concludes with <b>12:11-12</b>:
				<ul>
					<li>
						11 I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I behind the most 
						eminent apostles, though I am nothing. 
					</li>
					<li>
						12 Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				Note his reference to '<i><b>the</b> signs of an apostle'</i> which involved <i>'signs, wonders and mighty deeds'.</i>  This is in accordance 
				with another passage which speaks to the exercise of the sign gifts -- <b>cf. Hebrews 2:3-4.</b> Though I will not directly quote him, I need to 
				acknowledge once again my indebtedness to Robert Picirilli for most of what follows.  The passage in Hebrews outlines the progression of the course 
				of salvation.  It began with the <i>'Lord'</i> Himself speaking, and then continued to be preached and <i>'confirmed'</i>  by <i>'those who heard Him'</i> 
				to <i>'us.'</i>  Thus, three links or parts are described in the gospel chain.  Jesus, of course, worked miracles to validate His own identity 
				<b>(cf. John 20:30-31).</b>  But we see that <b>v. 4</b> refers to <i>'those who heard Him'</i> (i.e., the apostles -- <b>cf. I John 1:1</b>) as likewise 
				being validated by <i>'God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit,...'</i>  So there seems 
				to be a close association between the sign gifts and the apostolic office.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is confirmed with what actually happens in Acts and here I will quote Picirilli:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						An attentive reading of Acts, especially the first several chapters, is interesting for its emphasis on the works of the apostles.  The following 
						are noteworthy:
						<ul>
							<li>
								2:43: “Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.”  Chapter three provides a specific example.
							</li>
							<li>
								4:33: “With great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.”  Chapter five provides a specific example.
							</li>
							<li>
								5:12: “And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonder wrought among the people.”  The following verses provide a 
								specific example.
							</li>
						</ul>
						This has all the appearance of a deliberate pattern, one that links the signs and wonders with the ministry of the apostles.  This does not 
						mean, of course, that absolutely no one else performed such miraculous works.  Both Stephen (Acts 6:8) and Philip (Acts 8:6, 13) were 
						instruments of such power, but it seems likely that their gift came at the hands of the apostles (Acts 6:6). <i>(Is the Gift of Tongues 
					for Today?</i>, p. 4.)</p>

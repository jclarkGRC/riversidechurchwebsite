			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 2</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We began this section on Pertinent Questions by asking about the nature of the spiritual 
				gift of speaking in tongues. While I submit that the most biblically consistent position is that the gift was always the miraculous ability 
				to speak in a human language previously unknown to and unstudied by the individual speaking, others have said it might be other things. We 
				examined the position of Pentecostals who say that it also included speaking in heavenly languages and use I Corinthians 13:1 as their 
				basis.  However, as we saw, examining the context of that passage leaves little to recommend that view.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moving on to a second position brings us to a more recent (historically speaking) incarnation 
				of the Charismatic movement.  The 'third wave' of Pentecostal/ Charismatic thought (perhaps best characterized by today's Vineyard movement) 
				also distinguishes between what was happening in Acts 2 and the spiritual gift Paul spoke of in I Corinthians.  As we noted earlier in this 
				presentation the Third Wave, as they are called, which has some definite doctrinal differences with the earlier Pentecostal groups (cf. history 
				section in pp.1-4) concedes that  "<i>The tongues in Acts 2 were human languages and that today's charismatics are <b>not</b> speaking human 
					languages."</i></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those are two admissions we can certainly appreciate.  As we have seen, anything except an 
				acknowledgment that the tongues speaking in Acts 2 was all about human languages is almost absurd if one is looking honestly at the text.  
				The second admission is more subjective.  Can one listen to human utterances which one don't understand and determine if what is being 
				verbalized is actually language or not?  Ronald Baxter in his <i>Charismatic Gift of Tongues</i> (pp. 82-86) gives attention to this matter.  
				He cites four instances where linguistic experts listened to recorded episodes of modern tongues speaking and concluded, based on normal 
				patterns of speech and other technical matters, that nothing they heard was even remotely like real language.  John MacArthur, Jr. in his 
				<i>Charismatic Chaos</i> also cites a similar expert confirming the same (p. 278).  This, of course, once again brings into question what is 
				really happening in today's charismatic churches.  But apparently it is only a concern to those who are uneasy about modern tongues in the 
				first place.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I say that because, despite these admissions, Third Wave apologists believe that the tongues 
				speaking Paul was instructing the Corinthians about <i>was</i> a prayer language which, while not so great for public display, was nevertheless 
				very appropriate for private time with God.  This is because, they would say, it is a language only God can understand.  There is a fine line 
				between this and the other <i>'heavenly language'</i> position but the distinction is there (i.e., angelic language is not involved).  This is 
				a very common and, some would say, harmless or neutral position to take because if tongues are only used in private then what is the harm?  
				We'll come back to that question but the implication is that if it's not displayed in public no one should have an issue with the practice.  
				Whether that is so or not, there is a much more important question to consider about their position, namely: do they have a sound biblical 
				basis for adopting such a view?  Let's see.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They usually cite from <b>I Corinthians 14</b> to make their case:
				<ul>
					<li>
						13 Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret. 
					</li>
					<li>
						14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. 
					</li>
					<li>
						15 What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, 
						and I will also sing with the understanding. 
					</li>
					<li>
						16 Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say “Amen” at your giving of thanks, 
						since he does not understand what you say? 
					</li>
					<li>
						17 For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified.
					</li>
					<li>
						18 I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all; 
					</li>
					<li>
						19 yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in 
						a tongue.
					</li>
				</ul>
				From these verses they teach that Paul was instructing or at least allowing them to use tongues while praying in private.  And, further, that 
				the passage suggests and affirms that there is a proper time for praying in such a way that the mind is divorced from the process and only the 
				spirit is in play.  But is all this so?  Once more the context must be considered.  First, we again note that the overall tenor of Paul's 
				comments about the Corinthian's practice of tongues is overwhelmingly negative.  He neither commends nor encourages their approach to tongues.  
				He <i>allows</i> it under certain conditions (e.g., interpretation and self-restraint -- <b>vv. 27-28</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, Paul's comments about prayer are clearly about a public setting not a private one.  
				Their public worship service is, in fact, the context of this whole chapter.  He is not speaking to their personal devotional time at all.  
				Some assume that <b>v. 18</b> refers to Paul's personal prayer time.  I do not believe this is true but we will discuss that further when we 
				look at the purpose of the gift of tongues.  The point is there is no warrant for trying to make tongues in this chapter into a private 
				devotional time practice.  It's just not there! </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Third,  Paul's comments about praying with and without understanding do not necessarily mean 
				one is better than the other depending on the situation so both are valid.  A better interpretation is Paul prefers to pray (and sing) in his 
				own language so both mind and spirit are engaged rather than just the spirit.  Or are we to think that praying in a language we understand can 
				never be a truly spiritual experience?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally the fact that Paul requires interpretation almost necessitates that the <i>tongues</i> 
				here be seen as a real language, not something otherworldly or which only God can understand.  As MacArthur says,  <i>"Such a command would not be 
				apropos if Paul had in mind the ecstatic babbling of a 'private' prayer language or spontaneous celestial sounds."</i> (<i>Charismatic Chaos</i>, 
					p. 277.)   To conclude, it seems much more likely that <i>tongues</i> was always the ability to speak in a real human language which was 
					previously unknown to the one speaking it.  These other views involving languages beyond human ken have little (if any) biblical basis.  
					This view will be further confirmed as we look at the purpose of the spiritual gift of speaking in tongues.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last time we considered three quotes from men formerly involved in charismatic circles who 
				have since repudiated those kinds of practices and insist that they are not as harmless as some would have us believe.  They referred to the 
				possibility of Christians seeking such experiences coming to a place of longing for and needing them psychologically.  In addition, 
				they suggested that the mistake of making such experiences equate to advanced spirituality can cause great disappointment when, after the 
				ecstatic state is over, nothing in their lives really changes and they become disappointed, and either try to "fake it," or step back, or 
				walk away completely. Also mentioned was the innate selfishness involved when a gift is sought solely for self-edification instead of service 
				to others.  These are unquestionably negative results if they occur in the life of a believer.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is it accurate or fair to suggest that this will be the case for <i>every</i> person who 
				thinks that speaking in tongues is still valid for today?  No.  Robert Picirilli (<i>What the Bible Says About Tongues</i>, p. 23) affirms 
				that for some (perhaps 'many' is more accurate) tongues speakers, this ecstatic speech is equivalent to raising one's hands, or shouting 
				"Amen!" and "Hallelujah!", or clapping, or crying, or some other form of physical expression.  In other words, for some it is simply the 
				way they express spiritual or emotional excitement because that is what they have been raised around.  In that sense it does very little 
				harm <b>if</b> that's all it is about.  But even at that I hesitate to say that the public display of such tongues is completely benign 
				because when you begin to involve others in it, as in a church service for instance, I think it is difficult for there not to be some sort 
				of comparison or competition among the practitioners.  And then what of those who do not genuinely experience the phenomenon, whatever the 
				source of it may be, what does that do to them?  Do they feel left out or inadequate?  I think it would take a very loving and spiritually 
				mature congregation to pull it off (certainly not an impossibility but...maybe unlikely?).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I submit that it is much more likely, and quite reasonable, to suppose that the person who 
				practices this sort of speech in private, and does not think that it is something all Christians must partake in, and does not take it to be 
				a sign of superior Christian maturity or a special closeness to God, may well be able to do so without all the negative effects previously 
				referenced.  It is the attitude toward others which is most important, I think. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I certainly do believe that it is a legitimate thing to feel emotionally moved and close to 
				God when worshipping Him personally.  I do not think it requires one to speak ecstatically in order to experience such feelings.  Yet I would 
				never presume to dictate what others should or should not do in their private worship.  But if a tongues speaker asked my opinion of their 
				personal worship including "tongues" I would tell them honestly (or perhaps refer them to this 'brief' study) because I am concerned that 
				their personal practices and worship be based on sound biblical exposition rather than merely on subjective personal experience.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Summary Statement</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To conclude I want to sum up what we have discovered.  I will not make any references to 
				biblical passages or scholars nor will I try to make any arguments at this point.  All that is contained in the above pages.  We found that 
				instances of speaking in tongues have been relatively rare in church history with this most recent 'outbreak' in the twentieth century being 
				the most sustained.  Likewise, references to it in the New Testament are very limited -- it only appears in three of the books: Mark, Acts 
				and I Corinthians.  The most consistent biblical position is that all recorded episodes of speaking in tongues are the same, that is, they 
				were the miraculous ability of a person to speak in a real human language which he or she did not previously (or subsequently) know.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose of the gift of tongues was to be a sign.  It signified two main truths.  First, 
				it demonstrated to the Jews that Gentiles were to be included in God's kingdom and judgment awaited those Jews who did not accept Jesus as 
				Messiah.  Second, it, along with the other miraculous sign gifts, helped confirm the identity of God's true Apostles.  The first truth of 
				Gentile inclusion was well on its way to being fully accepted by the end of Paul's ministry and the Apostles were dead and gone by the end 
				of the first century AD.   Cessationists believe primarily for these two reasons that the Holy Spirit ceased distributing the gift of tongues 
				at some point probably in the first century.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We saw that what is happening in modern churches with regard to tongues is not in alignment 
				with what we see in the New Testament: the ecstatic speech of today is not real human language;  the gift of tongues was never sought as it is 
				today;  and much of modern tongues practice runs counter to Paul's statements in I Corinthians 14.  The most common ideas of what may be happening 
				with regard to the modern tongues movement is that it may be due in part to unholy spiritual influences, or that it is mostly learned behavior, 
				or that it comes from emotional or psychological inducements.  There is also the real possibility that participating in today's tongues movement 
				can cause harm in either an individual's life or in a local church.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I understand that there will be many who disagree with these positions.  I nevertheless hope that 
				this study has been fair, sound, and helpful to the reader.</font></p>

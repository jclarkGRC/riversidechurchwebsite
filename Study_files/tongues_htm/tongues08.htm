			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Biblical Passages - 4</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In continuing to examine the New Testament passages which actually discuss the usage of 
				tongues we have, so far, seen Mark 16 where Jesus announced that  speaking in tongues would be one of the signs following a believer, Acts 2 
				which is the first and best known instance of actual tongues speaking on the day of Pentecost after Jesus' resurrection, and then Acts 10 
				where Peter shared the gospel with Gentiles and Acts 19 where Paul shared the gospel with disciples of John.  Both groups spoke in tongues 
				after they believed.  For more detail and discussion of these passages please see those earlier segments.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We now come to a lengthier passage in which Paul is going to give some very detailed 
				information and pointed instructions about the gift of speaking in tongues.  The entire context of the passage includes all of 
				<b>I Corinthians 12-14</b> because in those three chapters Paul is addressing the activities and attitudes of the people of the church 
				in Corinth with regard to spiritual gifts.  So while not every word in these chapters directly addresses speaking in tongues Paul is 
				establishing the ideal  approach to spiritual gifts as a whole.  I believe the principles he shares are extremely helpful today in framing 
				one's opinion about the modern day practice of speaking in tongues.  But please don't misunderstand--Paul <b><i>does</i></b> speak directly 
				and at length about the particular gift of speaking in tongues in this passage, especially in chapter 14.  It is there we will spend most 
				of our time.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before we begin looking at the passage I think a brief overview of I Corinthians will be 
				helpful.  This is an epistle (i.e., a letter) to a group of people, the members of the church located in Corinth, written for specific 
				purposes.  Unfortunately most of Paul's purpose seems to be to correct several problems which have surfaced and were threatening the well 
				being of the church.  Since the scope of this study does not include those other problems, we will focus on Paul's concerns about how the 
				members were abusing and misusing spiritual gifts in the worship services.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In <b>12:1-11</b> Paul begins by explaining the reality of the Holy Spirit and His work 
				in the lives of believers individually and in the church as a whole.  One important way the Spirit helps the church is by giving individual 
				Christians certain gifts.  He emphasizes that while the Spirit may distribute a diverse array of these gifts to different Christians the purpose 
				of all the gifts is the same, that is, to benefit the entire church.  He also reinforces that all the gifts, no matter what they are, manifest 
				from <b><i>one and the same Holy Spirit</i></b> (v. 11).  He alone decides and determines which gifts are given to individual believers.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In <b>vv. 12-26</b> Paul emphasizes that just as the Spirit is one and the same so 
				should the members of the church be unified to be as one.  To illustrate this point Paul uses the analogy of the human body which is made of 
				several parts which is nevertheless put together, works together and hurts together.  Just as it would be ridiculous to suppose that one part 
				of one body would contend against another part,  exhibit jealousy toward another, have a poor self image and withdraw, or exhibit arrogance 
				and exalt itself so it is equally foolish for one part of Christ's body to do such to other parts.  As he wraps up chapter 12, Paul reminds 
				them that not all individuals have the same gifts and that the sovereign God has appointed certain ones to have certain gifts and offices.  
				Yet these gifts are not the most important thing.  Paul concludes by saying there is "a more excellent way."</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That phrase is his introduction to what is often called the Bible's 'love chapter.'  
				Paul gives an eloquent description of the qualities of true love and its practices in everyday life.  But perhaps most importantly for this 
				discussion, at the beginning of the chapter in <b>vv.1-3</b> he asserts that spiritual gifts are utterly useless if they are not motivated by 
				a brotherly love which is looking out for the best interest of others.  We will come back to the phrase in <b>v. 1</b> about the <i>"tongues 
				of men and of angels"</i> later when we discuss more about what some say the gift of tongues actually is.  He also makes some comments toward 
				the end of the chapter about the relative value of some spiritual gifts and this fruit of the spirit, love, because while some gifts would 
				eventually vanish, love will continue indefinitely.  We will also come back to these verses when we talk about the nature of various spiritual 
				gifts, i.e., were they all meant to be permanent?  But for now we just need to realize that the context for this classic treatise on love is 
				actually with regard to how the church people of Corinth were misusing their spiritual gifts in such a way that the body was being harmed.  Paul 
				was trying to instruct them on how their relationships <i>should</i> look rather than how they were in reality at that time due to some 
				misunderstandings about the spiritual gift of speaking in tongues.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which brings us then to chapter 14 in which Paul really focuses on speaking in tongues and its 
				relative value compared to the gift of prophecy.  Paul has some real misgivings about what is going on in Corinth.  He also gives some very 
				strongly worded directives about the use of tongues in public worship services.  We'll see those in the next segment.</font></p>

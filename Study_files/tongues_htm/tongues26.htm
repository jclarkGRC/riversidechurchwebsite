			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pertinent Questions - 17</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the prior segment we concluded looking at how what is happening in today's churches which 
				practice tongues is not in alignment with what we see happening in the New Testament and also runs counter to Paul's instructions to the Corinthian 
				church in chapter 14 of his first letter to them.  Specifically we saw how the tongues speakers and the prophets could control whether they 
				exercised their gift or remained silent which is contrary to the popular modern notion that "manifestations of the Spirit" are beyond the control 
				of the one evidencing them.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this session I want to begin addressing the following <b>pertinent question</b>: <i>If sign 
				gifts, including tongues, are not valid for today (i.e., the Holy Spirit has ceased giving them out because they are not necessary anymore), then 
				what is really going on in those churches which purport to possess and practice them?</i>  In other words, we have seen that modern churches are 
				not doing tongues (and other "signs") as they were done in the Apostolic era, but now we want to try to figure out what may actually be happening 
				as they do what they are doing.  There are several ideas which are commonly offered.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first one I will submit (though these are in no particular order) is that some tongues speakers 
				are being influenced by spiritual forces other than the Holy Spirit.  In other words, Satan or demonic power is involved somehow.  How do I know this 
				and, as some charismatics might ask, how could I even suggest such a thing?  I am sure many sincere believers who practice tongues in some form would 
				be deeply offended and/or horrified at being so accused.  I am sympathetic to their feelings.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, it is historic fact that "speaking in tongues" existed prior to the Christian era.  Robert 
				Picirilli, in his booklet <i>What the Bible Says about Tongues</i> (p. 20), cites Chris Parnell who asserts that <i>"tongues-speaking was well known 
				in the pre-Christian Mediterranean world."</i>  They were well known because several pagan religions in that region practiced it.  He also refers 
				(along with Richard Baxter, <i>Charismatic Gift of Tongues</i> pp. 88-93 and John MacArthur, <i>Charismatic Chaos</i> pp. 291-92) to the phenomenon 
				existing in East Africa where people involved in demon worship and possession spoke in Zulu, Swahili, and English even though these people had no 
				normal knowledge of these languages.  This was something also known among Mormons, at least early on, as Joseph Smith encouraged his followers to: 
				<i>"Arise upon your feet, speak or make some sound, continue to make sounds of some kind, and the Lord will make a tongue or language of it."</i> 
				(Baxter, p. 75.)   The practice is also known in the religions of Islam and Hinduism, among the monks of Tibet, and also among the Eskimos (Baxter 
				specifies those Eskimos who live in Greenland).  It is also seen in Central and South America among spiritist mediums who seek contact with the dead.  
				Similarly here in the United States those who are involved in witchcraft and New Age types of religions are familiar with and have experiences of 
				speaking in previously unknown languages.  This is only a partial recitation of recorded episodes.  So we see that there is really no portion of 
				the globe uninitiated to the phenomenon.  Clearly no genuine Christian would attribute the power of the Holy Spirit to any of these instances of 
				tongues speaking.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But does that mean that modern Pentecostals and charismatics are necessarily interacting with or 
				consorting with demons?  I would not go that far myself.  There are other explanations we will see which may account for many, if not most, instances.  
				However, if you will recall back to the opening of this study I wrote the following:  
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						According to John F. MacArthur, Jr., (<i>Charismatic Chaos</i>, pp. 285-86) there was no other significant  outbreak of tongues until the 
						seventeenth century:  among some French protestants sometimes called the Cevennol prophets; and some Roman Catholics known as the Jansenists; 
						and, in America, Mother Ann Lee's group, known as the Shakers.  One other group appeared in the early nineteenth century, sometimes referred 
						to as Irvingites after Scottish Presbyterian pastor Edward Irving.  All these groups, as the Montanists, are usually characterized as 
						unorthodox, fanatical and/or heretical.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is the point?  It is essentially that present day tongues speakers are not in good company 
				historically.  They must either be associated with the fringe groups who were eventually dismissed by their contemporary Christians as theologically 
				unsound <b>or</b>, even worse, they are reproducing the practices of false religions and the occult.  As a disciple of Christ, that is not a position 
				I would want to be in.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, I am <b>not</b> suggesting that every charismatic who claims to speak in tongues is demon 
				possessed or something of that sort.  That would be unwarranted and irresponsible on my part.  However I <b>would</b> suggest that for a charismatic 
				or a Pentecostal individual to not, at the very least, carefully consider the information I have just shared would likewise be an act of carelessness 
				on his part.  As many of the above cited authors have stated and, more importantly, as <b>I John 4:1ff</b> tells us, not every spirit that is out 
				there trying to influence us is from God.  It should be extremely sobering to understand that it is very possible to have a counterfeit spiritual 
				experience.  That realization should create a deep desire in us to evaluate <b>every</b> spiritual experience through the filter of biblical 
				guidance.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We'll look at some other possible explanations for modern tongues speaking in the next 
				segment.</font></p>

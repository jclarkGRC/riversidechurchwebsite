			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Sources of Authority:</strong></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Mormons accept four published works as given by God and therefore authoritative
				for faith and practice. They call these the &quot;<i>Four Standard Works</i>.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>I. The Holy Bible (King James Version)</strong></font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A. But they only accept it &quot;insofar as it is correctly translated
					&quot; (<i>Articles of Faith #8</i>).</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B. The Book of Mormon states that such a translation is impossible because
					the &quot;<i>great and abominable church</i>&quot; (usually interpreted to mean the Roman Catholic church) deleted and
					perverted the Word of God (I Nephi 13:24-27).</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="mormonphotos/images-3.jpeg" alt="Orson Pratt" width="95"
					height="119" align="right">C. Orson Pratt, an early apostle, wrote &quot;Who knows that even one verse of the Bible has escaped
					pollution, so as to convey the same sense now that it did in the original?&quot; (<i>Orson Pratt's Works</i>, p. 218)</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOTE:  This attitude, though completely erroneous, conveniently leaves the
						door open for Mormons to both ignore anything the Bible asserts which contradicts Mormon theology and also to add anything
						they wish which supports their views.  Thus, for the final word in doctrine and practice they hold very little regard for
						the Bible and rely completely upon the other three of the &quot;Four Standard Works.&quot;</font></p>
				</blockquote>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>II. Doctrine and Covenants</strong></font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A. Originally published in 1833 as the <i>Book of Commandments</i>.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B.  It was and is supposedly a record of more than 130 direct revelations of
					God to Joseph Smith and later prophets.  From it comes some of Mormonism's most distinctive doctrines such as baptism for the
					dead, the place and propriety of polygamy and also celestial marriage.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C.  In 1835 it was re-issued as <i>Doctrines and Covenants</i>.  There were at
					least 65,000 changes between the two publications (Ankerberg and Weldon, <i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 40).</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D.  Among other problems, this work contains much of Smith's false prophecy.
					Some examples are:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.  In Section 84:1-5, 31, Smith declares that a city and a temple would
						be built <i>&quot;in the Western boundaries of the state of Missouri ... in this generation&quot;</i>.   The specific
						place he intended was Jackson county.  This prophecy was made in 1834; the temple is yet to be built 170 years or more than
						<b>four</b> generations later.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.  One prophecy to which the Mormons like to refer is the one Smith made
						on December 25, 1832 concerning the Civil War in Section 87:1-8.  He wrote: <i>&quot;At the rebellion of South Carolina ...
						the Southern states will call on other nations, even the nation of Great Britain ... and then war shall be poured out on all
						nations.  And ... slaves shall rise up against their masters ... and that the remnants ... shall vex the Gentiles with a sore
						vexation.&quot;</i>  The Civil war did indeed break out with South Carolina leading the way in being first to vote to secede
						and firing on Fort Sumter, but the rest of the prophecy failed miserably.  England aided the Confederacy but never actually
						entered the war on the South's behalf, thus war was not <i>&quot;poured out on all nations.&quot;</i>  The slaves in the South
						did not rebel, nor did the <i>&quot;remnants&quot;</i> (the &quot;Jewish&quot; Indians of the Book of Mormon) attack and do
						great damage to the <i>&quot;Gentiles&quot;</i> but rather were themselves <i>&quot;vexed&quot;</i> by being defeated and/or
						through treaties were placed on reservations.  It should be noted that when Smith made the &quot;prophecy&quot;, it was
						conventional wisdom to predict a civil war as tensions were extremely high between the North and South.  In fact in November,
						1832, President Andrew Jackson put federal troops on alert because South Carolina refused to abide by a federal tariff act
						and threatened to secede.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>III. The Pearl of Great Price</strong></font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A.  Originally published in 1851, it is a compilation of several individual
					works, including the <i>Book of Moses</i>, the <i>Book of Abraham</i>, excerpts from Joseph Smith's autobiography, and the
					<i>Articles of Faith</i>.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B.  Again, between the original and later editions of this work there have
					been thousands of changes.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C. The books of Moses and Abraham contradict each other:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.  Moses 2:1:  <i>&quot;I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty
						God; by mine Only Begotten I created these things; yea, in the beginning I created the heaven, and the earth upon which thou
						standest.&quot;</i></font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.  Abraham 4:1: <i>&quot;And then the Lord said: Let us go down.  And
					they went down at the beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth.&quot;</i></font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D.  Furthermore, the Book of Abraham was discovered to be completely and
					irrefutably fraudulent.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.  An ancient Egyptian papyrus (manuscript) was discovered in the
						wrappings of some mummies.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.  In 1835, Smith became interested in these writings after seeing them
						in Kirtland, Ohio on July 3 and arranged to purchase them.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.  How delighted he was to &quot;discover&quot; that one of the scrolls
						was written by Abraham himself. He published his translation of this scroll in 1842 as the Book of Abraham.  He even
						included some of the drawings with interpretations; one such drawing was presented as Abraham seated on the throne of
						Pharaoh.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4.  After being lost for years, the writings were recovered by the
						Metropolitan Art Museum of New York who then officially presented them to the Latter-day Saints in 1967.  This event
						allowed scholars to study and evaluate Smith's translation.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="mormonphotos/images-4.jpeg" alt="Book of Abraham" width="130"
						height="88" hspace="10" align="right">5.  Their finding was that not a single word of his translation bore any resemblance
						to what was actually on the scrolls.  It was actually a Ptolemaic (post-Alexander the Great -- much, much later than
						Abraham's time) copy of the Egyptian <i>Book of Breathings</i> which was an extension of the occultic <i>Book of the Dead</i>,
						which relates to a soul's journeys after death.  What Smith had interpreted as Abraham on Pharaoh's throne was actually
						a representation of Osiris, the Egyptian god of the underworld judging the dead.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>IV. The Book of Mormon</strong></font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="mormonphotos/images-7.jpeg" alt="Book of Mormon" width="89"
					height="129" hspace="10" align="right">A.  This is by far the most important of the Four Standard Works in the hearts and
					minds of the Mormon faithful.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B.  It was published in 1830 after Joseph Smith allegedly translated the
					&quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; book of golden plates given to him by Moroni into English.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C.  It is the story of two ancient civilizations located on the American
					continents.  The following is an abbreviated account:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.  The first was established when the Jaredites left the tower of
						Babel, migrated to Europe, and crossed the Atlantic in barges to land on the east coast of Central America around
						2250 B.C.  They became corrupt and were completely destroyed by God.  Their story is related in the Book of Ether.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.  The second was the result of some Jews, led by a man named Lehi
						and his sons, Nephi and Laman, left Jerusalem around 600 B.C. before the Babylonian captivity, crossed the Pacific and
						landed on the west coast of South America.  After Lehi died, the people broke into two hostile factions, the Nephites
						and the Lamanites.  Because of their wickedness, God cursed the Lamanites with dark skin.  Not long after His
						resurrection, Jesus made an appearance to the righteous Nephites and revealed the Gospel to them.  However, tensions
						between them and the Lamanites increased until war broke out.  The Lamanites prevailed and from around A.D. 380-420
						in battles near Palmyra, NY the Nephites were finally annihilated. Just before the end the Nephite leader, Mormon, who
						had compiled a history of these civilizations and written them on golden plates, gave them to his son, Moroni, who
						finished them and then hid them for safekeeping.  The Lamanites with their dark skin became the people later known as
						the American Indians.</font></p>

			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. The Book of Mormon contradicts the Bible and history by stating that the
					Messiah would be born at Jerusalem (<b>Alma 7:10</b>).  Some Mormons claim that the reference to Jerusalem refers to the general
					area so there is no mistake.  Besides the fact that the general area was usually referred to as Judea, <b>1 Nephi 1:4</b>
					describes Jerusalem as a city, so there is no escaping the error.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b.  It also contradicts <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> about a controversial issue.
					In <b>Section 132</b> of D & C, Smith justifies polygamy on the basis that &quot;<i>God commanded Abraham</i>&quot; and
					&quot;<i>Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to wife</i>&quot;, therefore we should &quot;<i>do the works of Abraham</i>.&quot;  He also
					refers to David’s &quot;<i>many wives and concubines</i>.&quot;  But in <b>Jacob 2:24, 26-27</b> of the <i>Book of Mormon</i> we
					see a different story.  Monogamy is required.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>QUESTION:</b>  Which was written later and why do you suppose it was written
						that way?  As we have seen, <i>Doctrines and Covenants</i> was written later which implies that Smith decided that he wanted
						more than one woman to wife and tried to justify it through a new &quot;revelation.&quot;</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. There is also a contradiction about the importance and nature of baptism.
					In the <i>Book of Mormon</i> (<b>3 Nephi 12:2; Moroni 8:11</b>) the remission of sins is the result of water baptism.  But in
					<i>Doctrines and Covenants</i> section <b>20:37</b> those who show by &quot;works&quot; that &quot;<i>they have received ... the
					spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins</i>&quot; shall be &quot;<i>received by baptism into his church</i>.&quot;</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b>  This particular revelation almost caused a riot among the
						Saints.  Whereas before they only had to be baptized to have their sins forgiven, now there was a much more stringent
						requirement.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion:</b> These then are the works upon which Mormons base their
					lives and their hopes of life after death.  We have only skimmed the surface of the  multitudes of inaccuracies, contradictions
					and revisions.  Surely, we can conclude that these works are a prime example of the deceptions and lies that Satan places before
					the unsaved to keep them in the dark away from the true Jesus of the Bible.</font></p>

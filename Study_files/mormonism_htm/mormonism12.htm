				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>E. About Salvation</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When reading Mormon literature about what is necessary for a person to partake
					in salvation, statements are seen that appear to be quite orthodox, that is, they seem to be compatible with fundamental Biblical
					Christianity.  For instance, in their pamphlet <i>What the Mormons Think of Christ</i> by Bruce McConkie are the following
					comments:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot; <i>... he</i> [God] <i>has decreed that salvation comes in and through
						the atoning sacrifice of Christ, and he has sent his prophets, from age to age, to bear record of Christ and to teach the
						truths of the plan of salvation.</i>&quot; (p. 5);  &quot;<i>Salvation is in Christ today, as it was anciently, and as it ever
						will be. ... Since Christ is the center of all things pertaining to our salvation, and since our hope of eternal life is
						centered in him (or is vain)...</i>&quot;  (p. 8);  &quot;<i>All men are saved by grace alone without any act on their part,
						meaning that they are resurrected and become immortal because of the atoning sacrifice of Christ.</i>&quot; (p. 28).</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the face of it these statements sound fine to a Bible believing Christian.
					But do these statements accurately reflect the real position of the Latter-day Saints?  Once more we must look a little deeper to
					find the truth about their theology.</font></p>

					believe:</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1. Salvation is earned through <b>good works</b>.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b><i>The Articles of Faith (# 3)</i></b>-- &quot;<i>We believe that
						through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.</i>
						&quot;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>II Nephi 25:23</b>-- &quot;<i>For we labor diligently to write, to
						persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by
						grace that we are saved, after all we can do.</i>&quot;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>-- &quot;<i>In addition to this redemption from
						death, all men, by the grace of God, have the power to gain eternal life.  This is called salvation by grace coupled with
						obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.</i>&quot;  (<i>What the Mormons Think of Christ</i>, p. 28.)  <b>Note
						that this statement is a continuation of the one above from the same publication. Walter Martin referred to this as
						&quot;theological double talk&quot; (Kingdom of the Cults</b>, p. 221). <b>And:</b> &quot;<i>Many Protestants ... erroneously
						conclude that men are saved by grace alone without doing the works of righteousness.</i>&quot;  (<i>Doctrinal New Testament
						Commentary</i>, vol. 2, p. 294.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">d. <b>Heber C. Kimball</b>-- &quot;<i>I have the power to save myself, and
						if I do not save myself, who will save me?  All have that privilege, and naught can save us but obedience to the commandments
						of God.</i>&quot;  (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, vol. 3, p. 269.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b>  There are many, many more quotations like the ones above
						which may be referenced from most important Mormon leaders, past and present.  Ankerberg and Weldon comment: &quot;<i>From its
						inception, the Mormon Church has consistently and adamantly opposed the clear biblical teaching of justification by grace
						through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8,9; Philippians 3:9).  In fact, few religions are more hostile to the biblical teaching of
						salvation by grace than Mormonism.</i>&quot;  (<i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 29.)  One might ask how they can make statements like
						the ones in the opening paragraph of this section if this is true.  It goes back to the LDS ideas about the nature of
						salvation.  Nowhere is it more important to have a grasp of the way the Mormons use and twist traditional Christian
						terminology than when engaged with a member in a discussion about the doctrine of salvation.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let’s briefly examine their ideas.  First, salvation to Mormons is not
						just one category where you either have it and are going to heaven or you do not and are going to hell, as Christians
						believe.  To them there are two types of salvation which lead to different kinds of heaven, or hell as they might say
						(more on the various levels of heaven later).  The first salvation is referred to as <b><i>general salvation</i></b> and
						is also called <b>salvation by grace</b> because it happens to everyone whether they wish it or not.  What must be understood
						is that when a Mormon is talking about <i>salvation by grace</i> he is really speaking of the <i>physical</i> resurrection
						of every person or, in other words, their immortality.  <i>Everybody</i> will eventually be raised with a physical body.
						This was provided for by the shed blood of Christ (more on that momentarily).  Because they affirm this &quot;doctrine,&quot;
						Mormons are able to <i>claim</i> to those not understanding their terminology that they do indeed believe in &quot;salvation
						by grace.&quot;  However, <b>they do not apply the phrase &quot;<i>salvation by grace</i>&quot; to the determination of a
						person’s destiny after the judgment.</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which brings us to the second category which is often referred to as
						<b><i>individual salvation</i></b>.  There is a drastic distinction between the two, as the Mormon apostle James Talmage
						writes: &quot;<i>General salvation, in the sense of redemption from the effects of the fall (resurrection), comes to all
						without their seeking it; but that individual salvation, or rescue from the effects of personal sins, is to be acquired by
						each for himself by faith and good works.</i>&quot; (<i>Jesus the Christ</i>, p. 31.)  The upshot is that each person decides
						what his own destiny will be through the level of his commitment and obedience to the &quot;<i>gospel</i>&quot; (remember,
						to them,  the term &quot;gospel&quot; means the teachings of Mormonism).</font></p>
					<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What kinds of things must be done to attain a &quot;
						<u>full</u> salvation&quot; (also known as &quot;<i>eternal life</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>exaltation</i>&quot;)?  Rodger I.
						Anderson, a former Mormon, lists what is generally recognized for obtaining salvation among Mormons: &quot; <i>... 1)
						belief in Jesus Christ (seldom emphasized because of Christ's relative unimportance in Mormon theology); 2) belief in the
						prophetic calling of Joseph Smith and his successors; 3) belief in all cardinal doctrines of Mormonism with special emphasis
						upon: a) temple work (including baptism for the dead and eternal marriage); b) the Word of Wisdom (a dietary law forbidding the
						use of tobacco, intoxicants, coffee, and tea)</i> [cf. Doctrine and Covenants 89]; <i>and  c) salvation by works.</i>&quot;
						[essentially keeping all God’s commands] (<i>The Bible and Mormonism</i>, p. 16). Such things as official membership in the
						LDS church, personal baptism, tithing, missionary endeavors, personal morality and worthiness, etc. are all indispensable
						practices if one is to have a chance at a &quot;full salvation.&quot;  Again, all this is part of the progression toward
						godhood, which is the ultimate goal of Mormonism.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the issue of real, true salvation is important and bound to come up
						in any involved conversation with a Mormon, it is important to keep the distinction between <i>general salvation</i> (which
						to them is granted through God's grace) and <i>individual salvation</i> (which to them is earned through obedience) in mind.
						What can make this issue even more confusing and difficult to talk about is that, according to Mark Champneys, <i>&quot;Mormons
						will sometimes bounce back and forth between these concepts when discussing &quot;salvation.&quot;</i> (<i>Christianity
						Re-Defined By Mormonism</i>, p. 3.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True Christians believe that there is no hope of salvation through trying to
						keep God’s commands or good works.  This is because our sin has offended God too deeply for us to ever make it up -- our debt
						is way too much to repay.  We must also acknowledge that it is not possible for us to ever keep God’s laws perfectly -- no matter
						how hard we want to obey we will always find ourselves falling short because of our ever present sin nature.  How then do
						Mormons expect to make good on their own sin?  The answer is that Mormons have downplayed the seriousness of sin to the point
						that they believe that the <b>original fall</b> of Adam and Eve was not negative but rather a good thing in that they were
						then made &quot;<i>mortal</i>&quot; which is twisted to mean &quot;<i>able to have children</i>&quot; (<b>cf.
						2 Nephi 2:22-25</b>).  There was no sin in their action because it was a necessary part of God’s plan of salvation.  According
						to Joseph Fielding Smith &quot;<i>the fall of man came as a blessing in disguise. ... I never speak of the part Eve took in
						this fall as a sin, nor do I accuse Adam of sin. ... it is not always a sin to transgress a law.</i>&quot; (<i>Doctrines of
						Salvation</i>, vol. 1, pp. 114-15.)  Compare this approach to what is taught in <b>Romans 5:12,14,  I Corinthians 15:21-22</b>
						and <b>I John 3:4</b>!  But that viewpoint about sin among them is typical.  According to Rhodes and Bodine &quot;<i>Mormons have
						redefined sin so that it fits their peculiar theology.  They say that sin basically amounts to a wrong judgment, a mistake,
						an imperfection, or an inadequacy. The moral sting is taken out of the word 'sin' in Mormon vocabulary.  Theologians have long
						said that a weak view of sin always leads to a weak view of salvation.  There are no exceptions to this.  If sin is minimized,
						then the need for a Savior diminishes.</i>&quot;  (<i>Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Mormons</i>, pp. 361-62.)  Jesus
						said as much in <b>Luke 7:47</b>.  When we do not have a true sense of our own sinfulness, it is easy to imagine ourselves
						righteous or not in need of much help at all or able to make up for the &quot;small&quot; offenses we have caused to God.
						Thus it is with the Mormons in that they truly think they can earn full salvation by their own good works.  But Christians
						know salvation can only be obtained through God’s grace which is given to us when we place genuine faith in His provision
						through Jesus Christ.  Consider the following passages which clearly teach that attempted obedience to God’s law and good
						works cannot save man from death, sin and hell: <b>Romans 3:28; 4:1-2, 5; 11:6; Galatians 2:21; 3:1-3; 10-11; Ephesians 2:8-9;
						Philippians 3:4-9; Titus 3:4-7.</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does this mean that Christians can therefore be unconcerned about obeying
						God’s commands and doing good?  Absolutely not!  If so, Paul spent a lot of wasted breath, time and ink encouraging,
						admonishing and urging those he won to Christ to live right and to &quot;<i>walk worthy of the calling with which you were
						called</i>&quot; (<b>Ephesians 4:1</b>).  Christians are charged to dedicate their lives to pleasing and serving God with
						their entire beings (<b>cf. Romans 12:1-2</b>).  The <b><i>difference</i></b> is that Christians should do so with a heart
						of love and gratitude for having <b>already</b> been saved, <b>not</b> in order to <b>achieve</b> or <b>earn</b> salvation.
						In other words, good works for the Christian are the <i>result</i> or the <i>evidence</i> of his salvation, <b>not</b> the
						<i>cause</i> or the <i>source</i> of his salvation as Mormons think (<b>cf. Ephesians 2:10; Titus 3:8</b>).</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The <b>atoning work</b> of Christ is limited in its effectiveness.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <i><b>Church News</b>--  &quot;[Jesus] opened the door of immortality for
						all to walk through. He paid the price for us to rise from the grave.  Through His own willful sacrifice -- the infinite and
						eternal atonement -- we all shall live again.</i>&quot; (March 18, 1989, p. 16.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <i><b>Gospel Principles</b>-- &quot;[Jesus] became our savior and has
						done his part to help us return to our heavenly home.  It is now up to each of us to do our part and to prove ourselves
						worthy of exaltation.</i>&quot; (p. 17.) </font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>-- &quot;<i>Christians speak often of the blood of
						Christ and its cleansing power.  Much that is believed and taught on this subject, however, is such utter nonsense and so
						palpably false that to believe it is to lose one's salvation.  Many go so far, for instance, to believe that if we confess
						Christ with our lips and avow that we accept Him as our personal Savior, we are thereby saved.  His blood, without any other
						act than mere belief, they say, makes us clean.</i>&quot; (<i>What the Mormons Think of Christ</i>, p. 31.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FYI:</b>  Since we have already seen the differences Mormons make in the
						categories of salvation it is now easier to understand what they think of Christ’s role in the scheme of salvation.  Simply
						put, Jesus provided for <i>general salvation</i> (a physical resurrection) by bleeding in the Garden of Gethsemane and finally
						dying upon the cross.  According to LDS thinking since He paid that price and overcame death, we too, by God’s grace, will
						also eventually receive <i>immortality</i>.  This provision gives us a chance to progress to the next stage after this life
						is over.  Without it, we all would be stuck in permanent death (i.e., no body).  So again, they can make the claim to those
						not familiar with their lingo, that they believe that &quot;<i>salvation is in Christ.</i>&quot;  They use such phrases to
						make themselves look like real Christians.  But in (their) reality, beyond the <i>general salvation</i>, what Jesus did does
						not really help us all that much.  It is up to us to follow through and do what is required to achieve <i>individual
						salvation</i> if we desire it.  In this vastly more important arena of <i>exaltation</i>, according to Mormon thought,
						faith in Christ is almost worthless.  Contrast this attitude to what Jesus Himself said about His own mission (<b>cf. Matthew
						20:28; 26:28; Luke 19:10</b>) and what other Bible passages say He accomplished (<b>cf. John 1:29; I Corinthians 15:3;
						Ephesians 1:7; I Peter 2:24; I John 2:2</b>). Consider also what the Bible teaches about how to access that salvation
						(<b>cf. John 3:14-17; 5:24; Acts 16:30-31; Romans 10:9-11</b>).</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.  Salvation can be gained <b>after death</b>.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>James E. Talmage</b>-- &quot;<i>The Gospel must be proclaimed in the
						spirit world; and, that such work is provided for, the scriptures abundantly prove.  The inauguration of this work among the
						dead was effected by Christ in the interval between His death and resurrection.  While His body lay in the tomb, his spirit
						ministered to the spirits of the departed</i>.&quot; (<i>A Study of the Articles of Faith</i>, p. 147.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Joseph Fielding Smith</b>-- &quot;<i>Even the wicked of the earth ...
						shall at last come forth from the prison house, repentant and willing to bow the knee and acknowledge Christ,</i> ... &quot;
						(<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>, vol. 2, pp. 220-21.)  <b>And:</b> &quot;<i>It is decreed that the unrighteous shall have to
						spend their time during this thousand years in the prison house prepared for them where they can repent and cleanse themselves
						through the things which they shall suffer.</i>&quot; (<i>Ibid</i>., vol. 3, p. 60.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOTE:  The Mormon position concerning death is that at the moment life
						ceases the person’s spirit enters the spirit world.  The Mormon faithful enter a place called &quot;<i>paradise</i>&quot;
						where they continue to work at their progression toward godhood until the day of judgment.  Non-Mormons go to a spirit
						prison to wait until final judgment.  While they are waiting the Mormon spirits apparently have the chance to come over
						from paradise and evangelize them.  If a spirit in prison decides to accept the teachings of Joseph Smith and his successors,
						he or she is then free to leave the prison and enter paradise <b><i>provided</i></b> that a still living relative has been
						baptized on his or her behalf in a Mormon temple.  If this has not happened then the spirit is stuck in prison until it does.
						After entering paradise the spirit is free to begin working toward his or her own progression (though, no doubt, they have a
						lot of catching up to do).</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus the Mormons adhere to a version of the Roman Catholic doctrine of
						purgatory in which things can be fixed up with God after death.  Traditional, evangelical Christianity rejects this notion,
						of course (<b>cf. Luke 16:19-31; II Corinthians 6:2; Hebrews 9:27</b>).  And to the Latter-day Saints’ embarrassment, the
						Book of Mormon rejects it as well in <b>Alma 34:31-35</b>.  Mormons like to point to <b>I Peter 3:18-19; 4:6</b> as support
						for their position (ironic that they must turn to the Bible for their help when their own &quot;sacred&quot; book will not
						do).  These are admittedly difficult passages with good Bible scholars taking various positions.  However, a fundamental
						principle of Bible interpretation is that we interpret the harder, more obscure Scripture with easier to understand and
						clearer passages that address the same subject.  In light of the already observed passages, all the aforementioned scholars
						are in agreement that the <b>I Peter</b> passages do not imply a second chance for people after they die. So here, too,
						Mormon theology comes up short -- it is not in agreement with Christian belief.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We should also mention their practice of <b>baptizing for the dead</b>.
						In their work, <i>Major Problems of Mormonism</i> (pp. 229-30), Jerald and Sandra Tanner mention that because of the Mormon
						belief that, in the words of Joseph Smith, &quot;<i>The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to
						seek after our dead,</i>&quot; multitudes of millions of dollars, untold hours of time and enormous amounts of energy are
						spent in the building of temples and upon endless genealogical research.  They compare the Mormon church to ancient Egyptian
						culture which spent so much care upon the dead in mummification processes, pyramids and occultic religions.  They comment
						that &quot;<i>it is certainly sad that the Mormon church spends so much time and money searching for the names of the dead
						when there are so many needy struggling to stay alive.  It would seem to be far better to spend this money and time on the
						living and let the Lord take care of the dead.</i>&quot;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As with their idea of purgatory, neither does the <i>Book of Mormon</i>
						mention or support the practice of <b>baptizing for the dead</b>.  It does, however, state that those who die without
						hearing the true (Mormon) &quot;gospel&quot; are automatically saved and do not need to be baptized (<b>cf. Moroni 8:22-24</b>).
						Again, they are constrained to point (incorrectly) to the Bible in <b>I Corinthians 15:29</b> for their justification of the
						practice.  James Talmage writes, &quot;<i>These words are unambiguous and the fact that they are presented without explanation
						or comment argues that the principle of baptism for the dead was understood among the people to whom the letter was addressed.
						... herein is shown the necessity of vicarious work -- the living ministering in behalf of the dead; the children doing for
						their progenitors what is beyond their power to do for themselves.</i>&quot; (<i>A Study of the Articles of Faith</i>, pp.
						149-150.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only thing &quot;unambiguous&quot; about the passage is that somebody
						was baptizing for the dead and Paul was using that as an illustration to make a point.  The context (vv. 12-33) is that
						&quot;<i>some among you</i>&quot; in the church at Corinth were saying that there was &quot;<i>no resurrection</i>.&quot;
						By his statement in v. 29 Paul implies that some of those who doubted the resurrection were also some of the ones baptizing
						for the dead and he is seeking to show the foolishness of such a contradictory position.  He neither condemns nor endorses
						nor commands the practice.  But something else should be noted.  All through the first letter to the Corinthians Paul is
						continually using first and second person pronouns (&quot;<i>I</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>we</i>,&quot; &quot;<i>you</i>&quot;)
						to either bind himself to them or to address them directly.  But here he uses the third person &quot;<i>they</i>&quot; for
						the first and only time.  This seems to imply that Paul is perhaps referring to a group on the fringes or outside the core
						church group who would be reading this letter.  At the very least, as Ron Rhodes notes, he &quot;<i>seems to be disassociating
						himself from the group practicing baptism for the dead.</i>&quot; (<i>Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Mormons</i>,
						p. 346.)  Just because one references a practice or behavior to make a particular point does not mean he endorses that
						practice or behavior.  But more to the point is that neither any Old Testament prophet, New Testament apostle nor even
						Jesus Himself ever made reference to <i>baptizing for the dead</i> other than this one obscure mention by Paul.  If it was
						so important to God, as Mormons believe, you’d think we’d have more information about it.</font></p>

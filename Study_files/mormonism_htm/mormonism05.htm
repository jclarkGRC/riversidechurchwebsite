			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Translation:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a.  In the <i>Pearl of Great Price</i>, in Joseph Smith’s writings (2:62-65)
						he claimed that a colleague, Martin Harris, took a portion of Smith's translation work to an expert, Professor Charles Anthon,
						who allegedly confirmed both the legitimacy of the characters and the accuracy of the translation.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b.  In a letter to E.D. Howe who was investigating the claims of Smith and
						Mormonism, Dr. Anthon categorically denied that he had confirmed Smith's work as legitimate.  He described the characters Harris
						had brought as a &quot;singular scrawl&quot; and warned him of being deceived by  &quot;rogues.&quot; (See Walter Martin,
						<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, pp. 180-183 for more detail.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c.  The Smithsonian Institution states that no report of finding any ancient
						Egyptian, Hebrew, or other Old World writings in pre-Columbian (before 1492) America has ever stood up to close examination.
						Furthermore, no anthropologist nor any linguist anywhere has ever heard of or found the slightest trace of a &quot;reformed
						Egyptian&quot; language.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Archaeological evidence:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a.  The Book of Mormon describes these two ancient American civilizations as
						being extensive.  Such passages as: Mormon 1:7; 6:15a; 2 Nephi 5:15; Ether 9:17-19; 15:2; Helaman 3:8-9, 14 speak of these
						peoples filling the land with their building, trading, manufacturing, farming, fighting of wars, etc.  There are thirty-eight
						cities catalogued in the Book of Mormon.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b.  The laws of archaeological research demand that if these things are true,
						there must be some kind of evidence left behind for others to find.  Here are the facts about these matters:</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1)  None of the cities have ever been found.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2)  No inscriptions or manuscripts with any <i>Book of Mormon</i> names of
							people, nations, or places have ever been found.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3)  No evidence for any Old World domesticated food plants (wheat, barley,
							oats, rice, etc.) or animals (cattle, pigs, chickens, horses, donkeys, camels, elephants, etc.) in America before 1492, except
							dogs, has ever been found.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4)  No evidence of iron, steel, cement, glass, or silk in the Americas
							before 1492 has ever been found.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5)  No artifact of any kind supporting the Book of Mormon has ever been
							found.</font></p>
						<blockquote>
							<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>NOTE:</strong>   The <strong>Smithsonian Institute</strong>
								and the <strong>National Geographic Society</strong> are both on record as denying the claims of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>.
								Whereas the evidence for Biblical history is so great it convinced skeptics like Josh McDowell, Lee Strobel and the great
								archaeologist Sir William Ramsey, the case against the <i>Book of Mormon</i> is so devastating that prominent Mormon
								archaeologist Thomas Stewart Ferguson quit the church.  Likewise for Jerald and Sandra Tanner who now publish extensive
								and detailed information revealing the error of Mormon doctrine (Sandra is a great-great-granddaughter of Brigham Young
								while Jerald is thought to be descended from John Tanner, a colleague and helper of Joseph Smith in the 1830’s).</font></p>
						</blockquote>
					</blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c.  Mormons often point to the works and ruins of the Aztec, Mayan and Incan
						civilizations as evidence for the veracity of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>.  There are serious problems here as well:</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1)  If it is true that the American Indians are descendants of Lehi and
							his people (who were Jews), it would stand to reason there would be physiological and genetic similarities.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2)  To the contrary, anthropologists and geneticists have found that the
							various physical factors of the races from which the Jewish or Semitic people come bear little or no resemblance to those
							of the native American Indian.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3)  According to authorities such as W.C. Boyd and Bentley Glass, a
							geneticist at Johns Hopkins, the Semitic races are extracted from the Mediterranean Caucasoid type, while native Americans
							are Mongoloid, that is, most closely related to peoples of eastern, central and northeastern Asia.  This would tie in with
							the theory that the ancestors of the American Indians crossed a land bridge which once existed in the Bering Strait region
							(See Walter Martin, <i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, pp.184-186).</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4)  Also, there is no evidence that any pre-Columbian Indians had any
							knowledge of Christianity or the Bible.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5)  Furthermore, present evidence shows that the first people to actually
							reach America from the East (Europe) were Norsemen around A.D. 1000.  There is no evidence of Europeans or Middle Easterners
							ever being in Mexico, Central or South America prior to 1492.</font></p>
						<blockquote>
							<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>NOTE:</strong>  Be aware that your LDS acquaintance may say
								it is perfectly natural that the Native Americans have no genetic resemblance to Jews because of the curse laid upon
								the Lamanites.  Remember?  The curse that gave them their darker skin?  This claim by the Book of Mormon in 2 Nephi
								5:20-21 harkens back to the curse laid on Ham's son Canaan (Genesis 9:24-25), which used to be widely interpreted as
								dark skin for Africans and was even used to justify slavery.  This highly speculative interpretation has absolutely
								no scriptural support and is almost universally rejected in Christians today (thankfully).  It was engendered by racism.
								I would submit that this which was written by Smith is of the same character. They may also say it is not surprising
								that Native Americans had no knowledge of Christ or the Bible prior to 1492 because they had been "cut off" from it.
								Still one would think that even in a post-cataclysmic land which had formerly had so much knowledge of God there would
								be legends or myths or verbal histories that demonstrated some truth relating to their Jewish heritage.  Ultimately there
								is just  no reason to believe that the original inhabitants of the Americas had anything whatsoever to do with people of
								Jewish descent.  The artifacts and buildings of the great Central and South American Indian cultures in no way support
								the claims of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>.</font></p>

					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Revisions in the text:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a.  In the original 1830 edition Mosiah 21:28 reads: &quot;<i> ... king
						Benjamin had a gift from God whereby he could interpret such engravings ... </i>&quot;  The only problem is that according to
						Mosiah 6:5 King Benjamin was already dead.  This was corrected and now reads: &quot; <i>... king Mosiah had a gift ... </i>&quot;
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b.  The 1830 version of 1 Nephi 11:18 reads:  &quot;<i> ... Behold, the
						virgin which thou seest is the mother of God ... </i>&quot;  Since Mary could not be the literal mother of their earth
						deity &quot;Elohim&quot;, they had to change it to:  &quot;<i> ... Behold the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of
						God ...</i>&quot;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c.  Similarly, 1 Nephi 11:21 originally read:  &quot;<i> ... Behold the Lamb
						of God, yea, even the eternal Father!</i>&quot;  Now it reads: &quot;<i> ... Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the
						Eternal Father!</i>&quot;</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>FYI:</strong>  These are three of the more important of 3,913
							changes made in the 1830 edition of the <i>Book of Mormon</i> for one reason or another.  Many of the others were
							grammatical in nature (wrong tense, misspelled words, etc.).  However there are several more where the actual information
							in a verse is changed to make it internally consistent or because the doctrinal implications of a phrase were so unacceptable
							it had to be edited.  In the introduction to their book <i>3,913 Changes in the Book of Mormon</i>, Jerald and Sandra Tanner
							provide several quotations from Joseph Smith and other Mormon leaders confirming that their position was that the alleged
							translation of the plates were perfectly correct in their original form because it was translated &quot;<i>by the power of
							God</i>&quot; (Joseph Smith, <i>History of the Church</i>, Vol. 1 pp. 54-55).   Why then was it changed so many times?
							Eventually Mormon leaders, embarrassed by the bad grammar and legitimate assertions that God would not provide such faulty
							English to Smith for any translation of His Word, began to teach that God gave Smith the ideas but Smith expressed them in
							his own words.  It is obvious why they would edit the verses that were clearly wrong and/or contradicted their own doctrine.
							Still the necessity of the changes raises a huge red flag.  Somebody somewhere in this loop is wrong.  Today’s teaching is
							that Smith and the early leaders were wrong in their declarations about the book being absolutely correct.  If so, that means
							that Smith either copied errors that were already written on the alleged plates by Mormon or the <i>Book of Mormon</i> was
							not perfectly translated by the power of God as they so stridently claimed.  The other possibility is that today’s leaders
							are wrong to declare Smith’s translation to have errors.  But the  obvious mistakes which have now been corrected/edited make
							this extremely unlikely.  Past and present Mormon positions contradict each other.  It is clear the book cannot be trusted
							for the eternal destiny of one’s soul.</font></p>
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Plagiarism:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a.  The Book of Mormon contains some 27,000 words from the King James Bible.
						Former Mormons Jerald and Sandra Tanner (<i>The Case Against Mormonism</i>) list 400 instances where the <i>Book of Mormon</i>
						quotes the KJV New Testament almost verbatim.</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  How can a book written supposedly between
							600 B.C. and A.D. 421 could possibly contain such extensive quotations from the King James Bible not to be written for
							another 1200-2200 years?  Mormons might answer that since it is the same God speaking it is natural the same words would
							be used (cf. 2 Nephi 29:8).  But that answer is insufficient.  Why would the <i>translation from different languages</i>
							(Hebrew and Greek versus &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot;) <i>by different men who lived over 200 years apart</i> be word
							for word in so many places?   Even more interesting, why do words with obvious Greek derivations (e.g., <i>Jesus Christ,
							Timothy, Jonas, Alpha, Omega</i>) appear in a book which is being translated from &quot;reformed Egyptian?&quot;</font></p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b.  Furthermore, why does the Book of Mormon even contain King James
						translation errors?</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1)  In <b>Isaiah 4:5</b> the correct translation for the Hebrew word
							&quot;<i>chuppah</i>&quot; is &quot;<i>canopy</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>covering</i>&quot;, not &quot;<i>defense.</i>&quot;
							Compare <b>2 Nephi 14:5.</b></font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2)  In <b>Isaiah 5:25</b> the correct translation for
							&quot;<i>suchah</i>&quot; is &quot;<i>refuse</i>,&quot; not &quot;<i>torn</i>.&quot;   Compare <b>2 Nephi 15:25</b>.</font></p>
						<blockquote>
							<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>NOTE:</strong>  These translation errors are there because
								the King James translators didn't know any better at the time of their translation work.  Later Hebrew linguistic
								discovery corrected the error.  There is no problem with that because the original language of the manuscript was
								not in error, only their understanding of it.  But since Joseph Smith was allegedly copying and translating straight
								from the golden plates, either the original work was wrong or he was, once again raising a question about the
								reliability of the <i>Book of Mormon</i> as a source of truth.</font></p>
						</blockquote>
					</blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c.  One last question we might ask is why a man translating a work into English
						in 19th century America uses 17th century English as he transcribes the manuscript.  Wouldn't it make more sense that a man would
						use the vernacular of his day?</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>NOTE:</strong>  There are allegations that Smith stole the story
							line for the <i>Book of Mormon</i> from a novel by Solomon Spaulding, a retired minister who wrote several works of fictional
							romances with biblical backgrounds before his death in 1816.  He sometimes used the King James style of English in his books
							to make them seem more ancient or authentic.  (For more information see Walter Martin, <i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, pp.
							191-193.)  Another possible source which might have inspired Smith’s imagination for his <i>Book of Mormon</i> script was
							Rev. Ethan Smith’s novel <i>A View of the Hebrews</i>.  It is interesting that on the title page of the original 1830 edition
							and in the original <i>Testimony of the Eight Witnesses</i> about the <i>Book of Mormon</i>, Smith is described as the
							&quot;<i>Author and Proprietor of this work ... </i>&quot; which makes it appear that what follows is more like a novel
							less like a revelation.   Later, of course, those words were changed to &quot;<i>translator.</i>&quot;</font></p>

				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consistent with their skewed views of God the Father and the Son Jesus Christ,
					the Latter-day Saints also have ideas about the nature of mankind that are very different from traditional Christianity.  It is
					not so much about the basic essence of our make-up that is at issue -- both groups would agree that every person consists of a
					physical body and an immaterial spirit joined together to make each one a unique individual.  Neither does it have to do with
					whether or not God created us (as opposed to evolutionary theory, for instance) -- both camps would heartily endorse God’s
					involvement in man’s existence.  Rather the debate revolves mainly around the details of man’s origin and the possibilities
					involving his ultimate destiny.  The chart below outlines the differences.</font></p>

				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>** Supporting quotations and evidence of what Mormons really
					believe:</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 1. Man was <b>procreated</b> by God.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Brigham Young</b>- &quot;<i>When our father Adam came into the garden of
						Eden, he came into it with a celestial body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him. He helped to make and organize this
						world.  He is Michael, the Arch-angel, the ANCIENT OF DAYS! about whom holy men have written and spoken -- He is our FATHER and
						our God, and the only God with whom we have to do.</i>&quot; (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, Vol. 1., pp. 50-51.)  <b>And:</b>
						&quot;<i>How much unbelief exists in the minds of the Latter-day Saints in regard to one particular doctrine which I revealed
						to them, and which God revealed to me -- namely that Adam is our Father and God ... Our Father Adam helped to make this earth,
						... He brought one of his wives with him ... Then he said, 'I want my children who are in the spirit world to come and live here
						... I once dwelt upon an earth something like this, in a mortal state ... I want my children that were born to me in the spirit
						world to come here and take tabernacles of flesh that their spirits may have a house ... '</i>&quot; (<i>Deseret Evening News</i>,
						June 14, 1873.)</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b> There are a couple of things you need to know about this
							doctrine. First, as the second quotation above suggests, the idea that Adam and God are the same was extremely controversial
							among the Mormons even while Brigham Young was alive and teaching it. These days Mormons absolutely deny it. In fact,
							according to Jerald and Sandra Tanner in their work <i>Major Problems of Mormonism</i> (pp. 64-65) Bruce McConkie and others
							tried to deny that Young even taught it at all but there was too much evidence against them.  They recognize that it is an
							untenable notion but are in the embarrassing position that the teacher, Brigham Young, was one of their greatest prophets.
							Second, there is nothing else written (that I could find) about how Mormons believe the physical bodies of the first man and
							woman were brought forth.  Since they deny the Adam-God doctrine, I’m sure they must have another explanation, but I am unaware
							of what it might be.  My hunch is that they still hold to the idea that the original bodies of flesh (be it Adam and Eve or
							Cain and his wife or whoever) were also literally fathered by Elohim and one of his wives.  The emphasis one finds in Mormon
							writings is on the pre-existence of our spirits in heaven which were also procreated by God.  That they teach that God
							literally procreated all the spirit children in heaven is beyond dispute, as follows:</font></p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b.  <b>Bruce McConkie</b>- &quot;<i>This doctrine that there is a Mother in
						Heaven was affirmed in plainness by the First Presidency of the Church ... they said that 'man, as a spirit, was begotten and
						born of heavenly parents, and reared to maturity in the eternal mansions of the Father,'that man is the 'offspring of celestial
						parentage,' and that 'all men and women are in the similitude of the universal Father and Mother, and are literally the sons
						and daughters of Deity.' </i>&quot; (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, p. 516.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <i><b>Your Pre-Earth Life</b>- &quot;So you are, in reality, a descendant of
						God. He is your heavenly Father in a very literal sense.  You lived with him and associated with Him before you were born on earth.
						You are of the lineage of God.  What could be more glorious than to know that you once lived in the presence of God, 'our Father,'
						that you are, in very deed, his spirit child, ...</i>&quot; (p. 5.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Compare <b>Genesis 2:7a, 21-22; Jeremiah 27:5; Matthew 19:4</b>. Note that in
						the passages in Genesis we are told what God used for the raw material for mankind.  In <b>Jeremiah</b> we are told that God
						employed his &quot;power&quot; and His &quot;arm&quot; which, though metaphorical in how we understand the nature of God,
						certainly points toward production rather than reproduction.  (Incidentally, from the Mormon  perspective where God <i>does</i>
						have a literal body, this verse is even more damaging for obvious reasons.)  Finally, the word for <b><i>&quot;made&quot;</i></b>
						in <b>Matthew 19:4</b> is the Greek <i>poieo</i> which, according to W. E. Vine,  is used to refer to acts of
						&quot;<i>construction.</i>&quot;  Thus, we see that the Bible clearly teaches that God made man as a builder constructs something
						not as father begets children.  There is not a hint in the Bible that we are His &quot;<i>literal</i>&quot; children.  Now Mormons
						like to use <b>Acts 17:28-29</b> and <b>Romans 8:16-17</b> to &quot;prove&quot; their contention that we are procreated by God.
						These notions are easily defeated when one reads the entire context of each passage.  In Acts Paul is trying to show pagan
						unbelievers the nature of the one true God who &quot;<i>made</i>&quot; (<i>poieo</i>) everything -- including us.  Since, in that
						sense we are His &quot;<i>offspring</i>,&quot; the Athenians should not think of God as being a statue of metal or stone.  He is
						the living God, not a mere idol.  In Romans, Paul makes clear that we are God’s children and in His family through
						&quot;<i>adoption</i>&quot; <b>not</b> a natural birth.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.  Man <b>pre-existed</b> before life on earth.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <i><b>Your Pre-Earth Life</b>- &quot;To understand why you are here, you must
						understand your beginnings.  At birth you did not suddenly flare into existence out of nowhere.  You have always lived.  Before
						you were born to your earthly parents, you lived in the presence of God.</i>&quot;  (p. 1.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>- &quot;<i>Pre-existence is the term commonly used to
						describe the premortal existence of the spirit children of God the Father.</i>&quot; (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, p. 589.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>Richard LeGrand</b>- &quot;<i>We all lived in the spirit before we were
						born in the flesh ...</i>&quot; (<i>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder</i>, p. 39.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>**  Also note the quotations in the previous section which speak to this as
						well.</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Compare <b>Genesis 2:7</b>.  Notice how that after forming the body of the
						first man God then &quot;<i>breathed</i>&quot; into him and Adam’s life began.  We do not read that a spirit was waiting nearby to
						enter into the body of flesh.  Rather we see that God created both elements of man’s being (body and spirit) on the same occasion.
						Causing Adam’s spirit to be formed was the next step in the process of making (or constructing) this man.  Mormons try to use
						<b>Jeremiah 1:5</b> as a proof text saying that for God to know and call Jeremiah before his birth necessarily means he must have
						existed.  Obviously the answer is that God, who knows <i>everything</i> past, present and future, can know us before we exist.
						It might be a problem for us if Scripture said that <i>Jeremiah</i> knew God before Jeremiah was born but, of course, it does not.
						Mormons also like to use <b>John 6:38; 6:62; 17:4-5</b> to &quot;show&quot; that man pre-existed.  The basic flaw here, of course,
						is their assumption that Jesus is the same as everyone else.  God the Son <i><b>did</b></i> have a pre-existence before coming in
						the flesh as Jesus to save mankind from their sin.  However, the rest of us are not God, thus we come into existence at a point
						in time, namely, at our conception.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Man’s <b>placement</b> depends on pre-existence.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> a. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>- &quot;<i>In the pre-existent eternity various degrees
						of valiance and devotion to the truth were exhibited by different groups of our Father’s spirit offspring.  One third of the spirit
						hosts of heaven came out in open rebellion and were cast out without bodies, becoming the devil and his angels</i>
						(<i>D&C</i> 29:36-41; <i>Rev</i>. 12:2-9).  <i>The other two-thirds stood affirmatively for Christ; there were no neutrals. ... Of
						the two-thirds that followed Christ, however some were more valiant than others. ... Those who were less valiant in the
						pre-existence and who thereby had certain restrictions imposed upon them during mortality are known to us as negroes.  Such spirits
						are sent to earth through the lineage of Cain, the mark put upon him for his rebellion against God and murder of Abel being a
						black skin.</i> (<i>Moses</i> 5:16-41; 7:8, 12, 22.) Noah’s son Ham married Egyptus, a descendant of Cain, thus preserving the
						negro lineage through the flood</i> (<i>Abraham</i> 1:2-27).&quot; (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, 1966 ed., pp. 526-28.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Joseph Fielding Smith</b>- &quot;<i>There is a reason why one man is born
						black and with other  disadvantages, while another is born white with great advantages. The reason is that we once had an estate
						before we came here, and were obedient, more or less, to the laws that were given us there.  Those who were faithful in all things
						there received greater blessings here, and those who were not faithful received less.</i>&quot;  (<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>,
						Vol. 1, p. 61.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>Mark Petersen</b>- &quot;<i>Is there reason then why the type of birth we
						receive in this life is not a reflection of our worthiness or lack of it in the pre-existent life? ... Can we account in any other
						way for the birth of some of the children of God in darkest Africa, or in flood-ridden China, or among the starving hordes of
						India, while some of the rest of us are born here in the United States?  We cannot escape the conclusion that because of
						performance in our pre-existence some of us are born as Chinese, some as Japanese, some as Latter-day Saints.  These are rewards
						and punishments, fully in harmony with His established policy in dealing with sinners and saints, rewarding all according to
						their deeds.</i>&quot;  (From an address entitled <i>Race Problems -- As They Affect the Church</i> delivered at Brigham Young
						University, August 27, 1954.) </font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">d. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>- &quot;<i>Negroes in this life are denied the priesthood;
						under no circumstances can they hold this delegation of authority from the Almighty</i> (<i>Abraham</i> 1:20-27). <i>The gospel
						message of salvation is not carried affirmatively to them</i> (<i>Moses</i> 7:8,12,22), <i>although sometimes negroes search out
						the truth, join the Church, and become by righteous living heirs of the celestial kingdom of heaven. ... It is the Lord’s doing, is
						based on his eternal laws of justice, and grows out of the lack of spiritual valiance of those concerned in their first estate.
						</i>&quot;  (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, 1966 ed., pp. 526-28)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The Bible consistently teaches and affirms the unity and the equality of
						all men before God.  Consider <b>Genesis 1:26-28; 5:1-2; Romans 3:23; John 3:16; Matthew 28:19; Colossians 3:11; Revelation
						5:9</b>.  We all come from the same stock, we all have the same sin problem, God loves every one of us and provided salvation
						for all.  Neither outward appearances, gender, nor nationalities matter to the Lord who will redeem some from every people group
						on earth with no exceptions.  To claim that a person’s good circumstances here on earth are the result of an exemplary
						pre-existent life is simply an arrogant way of taking undeserved credit (for things you can’t even remember!) because you happen
						to have good opportunities in life. It is pride plain and simple and a way of justifying looking down on others.  It is foreign
						to true biblical Christianity.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b>  From the very beginning of the Mormon movement Joseph Smith and
						his followers disdained those with dark skin and denied their males membership in the priesthoods (which we will see is quite
						important to the Latter-day Saints).  But, obviously, the Mormons did not have a monopoly on discrimination and racism.  Sadly,
						many true believers in Christ who were in fundamental denominations had feelings and took positions about race that were
						certainly not honoring to God (some still do).  The difference between the two is that the Bible does not support such feelings.
						Hatred of other races arises in Christian circles because imperfect, fallible men have wrong views and then take and twist
						scriptures to defend them.  But even then, no real Christian, even one with prejudice to some degree, would deny that blacks
						(or whatever skin color) have the same access to God as whites (at least I hope not).  In Mormonism, their views are clearly
						seen <b><i>in</i></b> their sources of authority. It wasn’t until 1978, under heavy criticism and pressure from both inside
						and outside the church, that the Mormon president Spencer Kimball announced a new revelation that allowed black men to receive
						the priesthood (at which point McConkie’s statements were edited out of his book to reflect the new Mormon enlightenment).
						That it would take a &quot;<i>revelation</i>&quot; as such to change their stance is in itself telling.  Obviously, their
						discrimination against blacks was institutional in nature, or in other words, it was the official and accepted position of the
						LDS church.  It is also interesting that at a &quot;convenient&quot; point in time, &quot;God&quot; changed His mind about
						how &quot;His&quot; people were to treat their black brothers.  We will find that this is not an isolated case of such
						behavior. There have been other timely prophecies revealing &quot;new truths&quot; which made life easier for the church
						hierarchy.</font></p>

				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4.  Man’s <b>potential</b> to become a God.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Joseph Smith</b>- &quot;<i>First, God himself, who sits enthroned in
						yonder heavens, is a man like unto one of yourselves, that is the great secret. ... I am going to tell you how God came to be
						God.  We have imagined that God was God from all eternity. ... God himself, the Father of us all dwelt on earth the same as
						Jesus Christ did, ... You have got to learn how to be Gods yourselves; ... No man can learn you more than what I have told
						you.</i>&quot;  (<i>Times and Seasons</i>, Vol. 5, pp. 613-14.)  <b>And also:</b> &quot;<i>Here, then, is eternal life -- to
						know the only wise and true God; and you have got to learn how to be Gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the
						same as all Gods have done before you, namely, by going from one small degree to another, and from a small capacity to a great
						one; from grace to grace, from exaltation to exaltation.</i>&quot; (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, pp. 356-57.)
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Spencer Kimball</b>- &quot;<i>Brethren, 225,000 of you are here tonight.
						I suppose 225,000 of you may become gods.  There seems to be plenty of space out there in the universe.  And the Lord has proved
						that he knows how to do it.  I think he could make, or probably have us help make, worlds for all of us, for every one of us
						225,000.</i>&quot; (From a speech later published in <i>The Ensign</i>, Nov. 1975, p. 80.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <i><b>Your Pre-Earth Life</b>- &quot;In pre-earth life you had identity,
						personality, and a spirit body in the likeness of the mortal body now housing that spirit.  In that life with your Heavenly
						Father, ... you advanced in knowledge and obedience until you were ready to come to this earth.  Your pre-earth life ended when
						you were born to your mortal parents. ... To the end that you might further progress, God, in pre-earth life, presented his
						plan of salvation whereby you would be permitted to come to earth, to gain a physical body, and to mature in righteousness so
						that you could prepare to someday dwell again with him. ... Be assured that you are a spirit child of God.  You are of his
						lineage.  He has a plan of progression for you and for all his children.</i>&quot; (pp. 1, 4, 8.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FYI:</b>  To Mormons the point of the pre-earth life, then the mortal life,
						then the afterlife is this whole idea of <b>progression</b>.  You work at the first until you attain enough merit to advance to
						the next stage.  Then after your time on earth, if you are found worthy, you are allowed into the highest heaven (more on that
						later) and there you continue to work at the ultimate goal of becoming a god with a world of your own.  Of course this idea and
						dream of becoming like God is not new.  It has been repackaged and sold to new customers over and over (the New Age movement is
						another prime example) but ultimately it is the same false bill of goods Satan foisted upon Eve (Genesis 3:4-5).</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Compare <b>Exodus 9:13-14; Acts 14:11-15;  Revelation 19:9-10; 22:8-9.</b>
						Where do the Latter-day Saints get this idea of progression?  Not from the Bible! And not even from their own Book of Mormon
						(cf. Alma 11:22-31).  The Tanners comment that, &quot;<i>By the year 1844, Joseph Smith had completely disregarded the teachings
						of the Book of Mormon, for he declared that God is just an exalted man and that men could become Gods.</i>&quot; (<i>Major
						Problems of Mormonism</i>, p. 59.)  Christianity teaches that one day God will restore believers to their original, pre-fallen,
						sinless state. In that sense we will be &quot;glorified,&quot; &quot;exalted,&quot; or &quot;perfected,&quot; as it were. But
						even in that wonderful, unimaginable state of being, we will always be mere humans marveling at and worshipping the one true
						awesome Almighty God of the universe (<b>cf. Revelation 7:9-11</b>).  That will never change.</font></p>

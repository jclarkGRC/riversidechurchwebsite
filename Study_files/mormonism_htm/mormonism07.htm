			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A major reason the Latter-Day Saint cult is so dangerous with regard to their
				evangelistic endeavors is that they usually seek to pass themselves off as being just another branch of the Christian faith. A close
				look at what they believe reveals that whatever they are, they are <b>not</b> Christians!  As I say this, I'm aware that there are
				many Mormons (probably the vast majority) who are sincere in their faith, believe it to be the truth, and think that it is absolutely
				a form of Christianity.  Sadly, they are deceived.  The average Mormon may not even be aware of a lot of what we are going to examine
				and critique regarding how their beliefs differ from fundamental Christianity.  However, Mormon writings and documents confirm that
				the things we'll see in this section are indeed the official positions of their group.</font></p>
			 <blockquote>
			 	<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>I. Terminology</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A conversation with a Mormon can be confusing because you and he are using the
					same words about the same topics.  As you part company it may seem as if you agree about quite a lot.  The truth is that you are
					miles apart because the Saints have given new definitions to words used by Christians, sometimes even to the point of them
					meaning completely the opposite.  The following is a list of brief definitions of some key terms the way Mormons use them (most
					will be discussed more fully later).  Again, some Mormons may not even be aware of the difference, but these definitions are
					supported by Mormon documents.  (See Ankerberg and Weldon, <i>Cult Watch</i>, pp. 18-19; also McDowell and Stewart, <i>Handbook
					of Today’s Religions</i>, p. 78-79; also Mark Champneys, <i>Christianity Redefined by Mormonism.</i>)</font></p>
			 <blockquote>
			 	<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. <b>Christianity</b>- In the early days Mormons separated themselves from
					main-stream Christianity and condemned it as wholly and utterly apostatized from the &quot;true Gospel.&quot;  This idea is
					easily found in Joseph Smith’s testimony and his subsequent writings, the writings of Brigham Young and also of other early
					leaders such as Orson Pratt and Joseph Fielding Smith (cf., <i>Journal of Discourses</i>, vol. 6, pp. 163, 198; vol. 8,
					pp. 167, 171, 199; vol. 13, p. 225; <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, p. 322; <i>History of the Church</i>, vol. 1,
					p. lxxxvi; <i>The Seer</i>, May 1854, vol. 2, No. 3, pp. 259-60; vol. 2, No. 3, pp. 237, 239-40).  That this is still the true
					feeling of the church in more modern days is reflected in the writings of Mormon scholar Bruce McConkie (cf. <i>Mormon Doctrine</i>,
					pp. 132, 137-38;  <i>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary</i>, vol. 2, pp. 274, 280; vol. 3, pp. 85, 547, 550-51).  So they still
					separate themselves but not nearly so overtly as in earlier days.  In fact, Mormons seem eager these days to be identified as
					&quot;Christian&quot; and commonly categorize themselves as such. Yet they still do not see mainstream Christianity as correct
					but rather as a perversion of true doctrine.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. <b>God</b>- Most of the time this word refers to Elohim the Father (or
					procreator) of all life on earth who progressed from being a man like us to a place of exaltation and godhood.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. <b>Jesus Christ</b>- The first spirit child of Elohim (and his wife)
					eventually born as a man (like all of us) and progressed to the point of godhood. Aka Jehovah in the Old Testament and is a
					wholly different being/man from Elohim.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. <b>Holy Ghost</b>- The third god to whom the people of earth must account.
					He, too, was once a man but currently does not have a body of flesh and blood (unlike Elohim and Jesus who do) because his role is
					spiritual in nature (e.g., he is the source of the Mormon &quot;burning in the bosom&quot; phenomenon).  To Mormons <i>Holy Ghost</i>
					is not the same as <i>Holy Spirit</i>, <i>Spirit of God</i> or <i>Spirit of Christ</i> since those terms could refer to the spirit
					bodies of or the spiritual energy from those two entities.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. <b>Trinity</b>-  Simply the idea of a close coordination/cooperation of the
					three entirely separate gods of earth -- Elohim (the Father), Jehovah (Jesus the Son) and the Holy Ghost.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. <b>The Gospel</b>- The way of salvation/exaltation which is exclusively
					through the Mormon doctrine of progression from one stage to another by perfect obedience to the law in the Four Standard
					Works.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. <b>Born again</b>- Chiefly a reference to water baptism into the Mormon
					church.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. <b>Atonement</b>- Refers to Jesus’ work in which he died on the cross to
					make all people <i>immortal</i> (i.e., everyone will be physically resurrected no matter their spiritual state -- this is
					referred to as <i>general salvation</i> or <i>salvation by grace</i>). This term also refers to his shedding of blood while
					praying in Gethsemane to make it <i>possible</i> for people to repent (i.e., he atoned for the original sin of Adam but not
					for every individual’s personal sin).</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9. <b>True salvation/eternal life</b>- this is also referred to by Mormons as
					<i>individual salvation</i> or <i>exaltation</i>.  The final state of being is closer to what Christians think of when they use
					the term &quot;salvation,&quot; namely, that of dwelling with God Himself in heaven.  However, <i>this</i> salvation is not
					given by God’s grace but rather must be earned by the individual.  To earn it, an individual must <i>repent</i> (that is, confess
					each sin and <i>never</i> repeat it) and be <i>perfectly obedient</i> to the Mormon &quot;<i>law of the gospel</i>.&quot;</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10. <b>The Fall</b>- This is not viewed as a bad thing from Mormon perspective.
					They teach that Adam was given contradictory commands by God to either 1) not eat the fruit from the forbidden tree or 2) multiply
					and fill the earth.  Adam chose to disobey the first in order to fulfill the second because childbirth could only become possible
					after the fall.  This made it possible for all the spirit children up with Elohim in heaven to obtain physical bodies and continue
					pursuing their progression toward godhood.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11. <b>Death</b>- Just another step in the eternal progression--usually a step
					up.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12. <b>Heaven</b>- The general term refers to three kingdoms with varying
					degrees of glory.  The <i>Celestial</i> is the highest where Elohim dwells and is reserved for those Mormons who, through
					obedience, are deemed worthy of entering.  The <i>Terrestrial</i> is the second where lukewarm, non-practicing Mormons, well
					intentioned Christians, and people with good hearts and good will are allowed to dwell. The <i>Telestial</i> is the lowest where
					the completely unworthy (no faith in anything, criminals, etc.) are forced to abide. However even this level is a better situation
					than our earth is right now.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">13. <b>Hell</b>- Can refer to two places:  1) <i>Spirit prison</i> is a temporary
					place of confinement for the spirits of people who did not believe in Mormonism while on earth.  There they have a chance to listen
					to Mormon spirits preach the &quot;gospel&quot; and convert.  2) <i>Outer darkness</i> is a place of torment reserved for the devil,
					his angels, and maybe those who left Mormonism for Christianity and began to attack Mormon doctrine.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">14. <b>Virgin birth</b>- The birth of Christ which came about because of a
					physical sex act between Mary and Elohim.  In Mormon logic, a woman only loses her virginity when she has sex with a mortal man.
					Since Elohim is immortal (though still a man), Mary still qualifies as a virgin.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">15. <b>Man</b>- Begins as an eternal spark of intelligence which progresses
					until it is born a spirit child procreated by Elohim and one of his wives.  Dwells with God there until deemed worthy of a
					physical body on earth.  On earth, each individual progresses until death where he waits in paradise or spirit prison until the
					day of judgment reveals his final destination to one of the three kingdoms.  Those who make it to the Celestial Kingdom are
					eligible to continue their journey toward godhood.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">16. <b>Creation</b>- Matter is eternal. The current state (our earth) is here
					because Elohim and some other gods reorganized matter to make it.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">17. <b>The Scriptures</b>- To Mormons the term refers to the Four Standard Works:
					<i>King James Bible</i>, <i>Book of Mormon</i>, <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> and <i>Pearl of Great Price</i> plus the words of the
					Living Prophets.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">18. <b>The Bible</b>- Though technically a book of authority, it is not
					considered as reliable as the other three and can only be properly interpreted in light of Mormon theology, not for what it
					says on its own merits.</font></p>
			</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 2000 years the Christian church has generally agreed on the meanings of these
					words.  The meanings the Mormons attach to them are anything but Christian.  Why have they changed them?  Because they have relied
					on other authorities and opinions rather than the Bible alone to formulate their views.  In spite of their claims, Mormons are not
					Christians because they have left the standard doctrines of Christianity and offered new ones in their place.</font></p>

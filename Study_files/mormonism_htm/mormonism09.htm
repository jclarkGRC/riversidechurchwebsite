				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mormonism claims to believe in Jesus Christ as the Bible portrays Him.  The
					following quotations come from an educational pamphlet published by the Saints entitled <i><b>What the Mormons Think of
					Christ</b></i>: &quot;<i>Some people even in this day of education and enlightenment profess to believe that the Mormons (members
					of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) do not believe in Christ, but rather have some mystical theology based on
					a belief in Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, or Mormon. Nothing could be further from the truth ... Bible doctrine is Mormon doctrine,
					and Mormon doctrine is Bible doctrine.  They are one and the same</i>&quot;  (p. 2).  &quot;<i>Salvation is in Christ today, as
					it was anciently, and as it will ever be ... Since Christ is the center of all things pertaining to our salvation, and since
					our hope of eternal life is centered in him (or is vain)</i>&quot; ... (p. 8).  &quot;<i>Christ is our Redeemer and our
					Savior</i>&quot; (p. 25).  Such statements in LDS literature are misleading.  They sound good and would seem to indicate a
					solid understanding of who Jesus is and also His role in providing for man’s salvation.  But do these and other such claims
					really represent Mormon thought about Jesus?  Do they really believe the same about Him as Bible believing Christians do?

					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b> Talmage errs in trying to make &quot;Elohim&quot; and

							life on this earth and Jehovah the lesser, secondary god (Jesus).  In the Hebrew Old Testament these words were simply
							two different names for the same Being.  In many instances they are compounded together to say &quot;Jehovah the Mighty
							One&quot; or simply &quot;Jehovah God&quot; or &quot;LORD God&quot; (e.g. <b>Psalm 41:13</b>).  Jehovah (Yahweh) =

					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Compare <b>Isaiah 53:6,9</b> and <b>II Corinthians 5:21</b>.  The

				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> a. <b><i>What the Mormons Think of Christ</b>.- &quot;But it must not be
						forgotten, however little the doctrine is known and believed in the present so-called Christian world, that all men lived
						in a pre-existent estate before they were born into this world; all were born in pre-existence as the spirit children of
						the Father.  Christ was the Firstborn Spirit Child, and from that day forward he has had, in all things, the preeminence</i>.&quot;
						(pp. 35-36)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Milton Hunter</b>- &quot;<i>Jesus is man's spiritual brother.  We dwelt
						with Him in the spirit world as members of that large society of eternal intelligences, which included our Heavenly
						Parents</i>.&quot; (<i>The Gospel Through the Ages</i>, p. 21)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>J.H. Evans</b>- &quot;<i>As for the devil and his fellow spirits, they
						are brothers to man and also to Jesus and sons and daughters to God in the same sense that we are</i>.&quot;  (<i>An American
						Prophet</i>, p. 241)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">d. <b>B.H. Roberts</b>- &quot;<i>His humanity is to be recognized as real and
						ordinary -- whatever happened to Him may happen to anyone of us</i>.&quot;  (Citing Sir Oliver Lodge from Joseph Smith’s <i>King
						Follett Discourse</i>, p.11)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FYI:</b> According to Mormon theology, as the firstborn of all the spirit
						children, Jesus is an &quot;elder brother&quot; to all the other beings produced by Elohim and his wives. This includes Lucifer,
						all the demons, and all mankind.  As the writers of <i>Cult Watch</i> (Ankerberg and Weldon, p. 27) and also <i>Reasoning from
						the Scriptures with the Mormons</i> (Rhodes and Bodine, p. 270) point out, this theology means that the only difference between
						Jesus and us (and even with the devil himself) is a difference of degree not of kind.  In other words, Jesus has merely made it
						to a point to which we have not yet attained.  He is simply ahead of us but not fundamentally different from us.  With regard to
						Satan, Mormons teach that Lucifer, the second-born, fell from heaven because of his jealousy over Christ being chosen to be the
						savior of the world.  He (Satan) wanted to redeem the people of earth but &quot;the gods&quot; chose Jesus. In his anger and envy,
						he was cast out and began to actively resist the work of Christ and God.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Compare <b>John 1:18, 3:16</b> where He is referred to as <b>&quot;the only
					begotten Son.&quot;</b> This phrase doesn't mean He was generated or created by the Father as Mormons (and others) say.  Rather it's
					emphasizing His <b>uniqueness</b> in all the universe.  Walter Martin says that &quot;<i>the most authoritative lexicons and grammar
					books, not to mention numerous  scholarly works, all render 'monogenes' as 'only' or 'unique' 'the only member of a kin or kind,
					hence generally only.</i>'&quot; (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, pp. 114-115.)  Thus Christians take &quot;<i>only begotten</i>&quot;
					to refer to the uniqueness of Jesus as the one and only, one-of-a-kind Son of God.  Jack Stallings writes that it &quot;<i>is a
					compound of the noun meaning 'kind' or 'genus' (Greek genos) rather than the verb 'born' (Greek gennao).  It therefore literally
					means 'of a single kind' rather than 'only begotten.</i>'&quot; (<i>Randall House Bible Commentary on John</i>, p. 24.) See also
					<b>Hebrews 11:17</b> which refers to Isaac in this way.  Isaac was not Abraham’s only son and was not even his oldest son but he
					was the unique son through whom God’s promises to Abraham would be channeled toward fulfillment.  Thus the Mormon idea is that
					Jesus, though significant to this world, is really rather common and not necessarily very important in the larger scheme of the
					universe with its multitudes of gods.  Christians believe Jesus is unique, one-of-a-kind.  There is no other who is both divine
					and human.  He is the one God-man who became so in order to rescue us from sin, death and hell.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4.  Jesus was conceived through a <b>physical act</b>.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b> This is a key Christian doctrine which liberal theologians (who
						do not truly believe the Bible) have tried to undermine for years now.  But no one nor any other group has ever put forth a view
						of the virgin birth like Mormonism. Again they seek to be coy about their position. When <b>Richard L. Evans</b>, a high ranking
						Mormon, was being interviewed by <i>Look</i> magazine (Oct. 5, 1954) he was asked the question: &quot;<i>Do Mormons believe in
						the Virgin birth?</i>&quot;  His answer: &quot;<i>Yes. The Latter-day Saint accepts the miraculous conception of Jesus the
						Christ.</i>&quot;  Do they really?  What do they mean by &quot;miraculous conception?&quot;  Let's see.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Brigham Young</b>- &quot;<i>He (Christ) was not begotten by the Holy
						Ghost ... Jesus, our elder brother was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden of Eden, and who is
						our Father in Heaven.</i>&quot;  (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, Vol. 1, pp. 50-51)  <b>And:</b> &quot;<i>When the time came
						that His first-born, the Savior, should come into the world and take a tabernacle (body), the Father came Himself and favoured
						that spirit with a tabernacle instead of letting any other man do it.</i>&quot; (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, Vol. 4, p. 218)
						<b>Also:</b> &quot;<i>The man Joseph, the husband of Mary, did not, that we know of, have more than one wife, but Mary, the
						wife of Joseph, had another husband.</i>&quot; (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, Vol. 11, p. 268)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Apostle James Talmage</b>- &quot;<i></i> ... His (Christ's) unique
						status in the flesh as the offspring of a mortal mother (Mary) and of an immortal or resurrected and glorified, Father
						(Elohim).</i>&quot;  (<i>A Study of the Articles of Faith</i>, p. 473)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>- &quot;<i>Christ was begotten by an Immortal Father
						the same way that mortal men are begotten by mortal fathers.</i>&quot; (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, p. 547)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b>  Remember that Mormons believe God the Father has a physical
						body,  and is not a spirit, so such an interaction is quite plausible to them.  Nevertheless, this doctrine has more in common
						with the likes of Greek mythology where lustful gods, such as Zeus, would choose certain young women and father children
						(Hercules).  It is revolting, blasphemous and completely foreign to Biblical revelation.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Compare <b>Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 1:26-35</b>.  There are
						two major contradictions to Mormon doctrine from these scripture passages.  We see in the Gospel passages that the angel
						attributed the conception to the work of the Holy Spirit, not the Father.  Apparently this must be one of those places where
						the Bible was not &quot;<i>translated correctly</i>&quot; (<i>Mormon Articles of Faith</i>, #8).  Brigham Young taught that
						&quot;<i>Jesus Christ was not begotten by the Holy Ghost.</i>&quot; (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, Vol. 1, p. 51).  But even
						more troubling for them is the fact that the Book of Mormon confirms the same thing in <b>Alma 7:10</b>.   Despite this, in
						<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>, Joseph Fielding Smith declares that &quot;<i>They tell us the Book of Mormon and the Bible
						teach that Christ was begotten by the Holy Ghost.  I challenge that statement.  The Book of Mormon teaches no such thing!
						Neither does the Bible.</i>&quot;  (Vol. 1, p. 19)   (Maybe he should have looked up the passages himself instead of relying
						on what &quot;they tell us.&quot;)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second problem has to do with the idea of Mary being a
						&quot;virgin.&quot;  All the  passages either explicitly state or infer that the Savior was to be born of a woman who did
						&quot;<i>not know a man</i>.&quot;  It is plain and simple.  How do they explain this problem?  Bruce McConkie has a solution.
						It is interesting that, about this subject, he is adamant that words must be taken literally.  In <i>Mormon Doctrine</i> he
						states that &quot;<i>Each of the words is to be understood literally.  Only means <b>only</b>; begotten means <b>begotten</b>;
						and Son means <b>son</b> ... </i>&quot; (pp. 546-47) &quot;<i>And Christ was born into the world as the literal Son of this Holy
						Being; he was born in the same personal, real and literal sense that any mortal son is born to a mortal father.  There is
						nothing figurative about his paternity; he was begotten, conceived and born in the normal and natural course of events, ...
						Christ is the Son of Man, meaning that his Father (the Eternal God!) is a Holy Man.</i>&quot; (p. 742)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>QUICK QUESTION:</b> If everything that happened with Jesus’ conception
						was &quot;<i>normal and natural</i>&quot; then where do we find the &quot;<b>sign</b>&quot; promised in Isaiah which means
						that something miraculous was going to happen which would capture people's attention?</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But in spite of his insistence upon using words literally, McConkie changes
						his approach when explaining how Mary could still be called a &quot;virgin.&quot;  Cited by Rhodes, McConkie maintains in his
						book <i>Mormon Doctrine</i> that though she had sexual relations with the Father Elohim, she was <b><i>still</i></b> a virgin.
						Why?  He &quot;<i>fancifully argues that a 'virgin' is a woman who has had no sexual relations with a <b>mortal</b> man.
						Because God the Father was an <b><i>immortal</i></b> man, Mary remained a virgin after having relations with him.</i>”
						(<i>Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Mormons</i>, pp. 269-70)  McConkie writes, &quot;<i>Our Lord is the only mortal
						person ever born to a virgin, because he is the only person who ever had an immortal Father.</i>&quot; (p. 745)  For a man who
						is so hung up on taking words literally, it seems a little inconsistent to play fast and loose with the accepted meaning of a
						word when it gives you a problem. The supposed difference that it makes for Mary to have been with an immortal man as opposed
						to a mortal man is conjured up in the  man’s imagination.  Either way Mary would have participated in sex at which point she
						would then <i>not</i> be a virgin.  You can’t have it both ways.  Either the conception was a &quot;<i>normal and natural
						</i>&quot; event and she was not a virgin or it was miraculous as documented in the Bible (without sex) and she was.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>One last thought:</b>  Jerald and Sandra Tanner in their work, <i>Major
						Problems of Mormonism</i> (p. 68), raise an interesting question. Since we all (according to Mormon teaching), including Mary,
						were previously born to the Father and one of his wives as spirit children in the pre-existent state, wouldn’t any sexual
						relations that the Father had with Mary be considered incestuous?</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5.  Jesus was a <b>married polygamist</b>.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Orson Hyde</b>- &quot;<i>It will be borne in mind that once upon a
						time, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and upon a careful reading of that transaction, it will be discovered that no
						less a person than Jesus Christ was married on that occasion. If he was never married, his intimacy with Mary and Martha, and
						the other Mary also whom Jesus loved, must have been highly unbecoming and improper to say the best of it.</i>&quot;
						(<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, Vol. 13, p. 259)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Orson Pratt</b>- &quot;<i>Jesus was a Polygamist who married many
						honorable wives.</i>&quot; (<i>The Seer</i>, Nov. 1853, Vol. 1, p. 172.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--  Since at the time of the writings by these two &quot;prophets&quot; the
						Mormons officially practiced polygamy, it makes sense that they would try to tie the practice to Jesus.  But obviously, there
						are no scriptures which even hint at Jesus having a wife (even after a &quot;<i>careful reading</i>&quot;).  The men who wrote
						the four Gospels either traveled with Him for three years or interviewed those who did.  It seems that if Jesus had a wife
						they would know and someone would have mentioned it. It was inconsistent with His purpose that He would have married. He was
						focused on the will of the Father.  To say nothing of the fact that polygamy is against the teachings of scripture and the
						intentions of the Father for marriage (see Genesis 2:24).</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This then is the Jesus of the Mormons: He was a man who did not exist in
					eternity as God the Son but, rather, was procreated by Elohim as a spirit child like everyone else, thus making him a spirit
					brother to Lucifer, all men, angels and demons.  He needed salvation and had to earn His exaltation.  Then born later as a man on
					earth, but not, however, thru the agency of the Holy Spirit but thru a physical act of the Father and Mary.  And he himself was a
					polygamist while on earth. Does this sound like the Jesus Christ presented in the Bible?  Yet Mormon missionaries will come to
					your door and sincerely state that they are Christians who believe in the biblical Jesus Christ.  What's wrong with this
					picture?</font></p>

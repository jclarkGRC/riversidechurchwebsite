			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusions about Mormon doctrine:</b></font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been very forthright in attacking Mormon beliefs about God, Jesus, mankind,
					the living prophets, the priesthood, salvation and the hereafter.  In some instances I have written a little sarcastically because
					I personally have a hard time understanding how people of intelligence can buy into some of the ideas the Latter-day Saints espouse.
					However, people have the right to believe whatever they desire.  It is <b>not</b> my purpose to belittle or scoff at these beliefs
					simply for the sake of my own amusement or the reader’s entertainment.  It <b>is</b> my purpose to reveal to the reader the difference
					between Mormon doctrine and Christian doctrine.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mormons, in this day and time, emphasize that they, too, are Christians and believe
					what the Bible teaches.  We have seen that this is simply not true.  There is a vast gulf between the ideas of Joseph Smith and his
					adherents and the truths presented in the Bible. </font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Smith’s ideas apparently came from many places.  Some assert that the main plot of
					the <i>Book of Mormon</i> was stolen from a manuscript for a novel written by Solomon Spaulding (cf. Walter Martin, <i>Kingdom of the
					Cults</i>, pp. 192-193).  No doubt his experiences as a treasure hunter, his membership in the Free Masons (as asserted by the Tanners
					in <i>Major Problems of Mormonism</i>, p. 236 citing <i>History of the Church</i>, vol. 4, p. 551), and the many religious controversies
					of the day also provided him with inspiration.  Alexander Campbell writes: &quot;<i>This prophet Smith, through his stone spectacles,
					wrote on the plates of Nephi in his Book of Mormon every error and almost every truth discussed in New York for the last ten years.
					He decided all the great controversies: infant baptism, ordination, the Trinity, regeneration, repentance, justification, the fall of
					man, atonement, transubstantiation, fasting, penance, church government, religious experience, the call to the ministry, the general
					resurrection, the eternal punishment, who may baptize, and even the questions of Free Masonry, republican government and the rights of
					man.</i>&quot;  (cited by Ankerberg and Weldon in <i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 37.)</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later as he came to have more influence and power and his desires overruled his
					self-control, he simply changed the teachings when they became inconvenient and stifled his desires.  For instance, polygamy became
					acceptable (<i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> 132).  That is, until years later in 1890, faced with government action against the
					Latter-day Saints, then Mormon President Wilford Woodruff declared that the practice of polygamy must end.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whatever the source of his teachings and those of his followers it is clear from our
					study that the doctrines of the Latter-day Saints are not compatible with Christianity.  There is much more that could be said and
					other doctrines that could be examined but at this point they would be superfluous.  Our examination of the essential doctrines covered
					is sufficient to disprove that Mormonism and Christianity are the same.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course this presents a dilemma.  If they are not the same and Mormonism is not
					true and the only way to heaven is belief in the Christ of the Bible -- what is to be done? The obvious answer is that we must make
					an effort to convince them of the truth which will set them free.  Which brings us to the next section of our study which concerns
					the best ways to witness to Latter- day Saints.</font></p>

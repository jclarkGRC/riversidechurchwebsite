		<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="mormonphotos/prologue01.jpg" alt="Joseph Smith, Jr." width="229"
			height="300" align="left">Joseph Smith, Jr. was born December 23, 1805 in Sharon, Vermont.  In 1815 his family moved to Palmyra, New
			York and then over to Manchester four years later.  His father was locally notorious as a treasure hunter who was avid to find the
			loot of the legendary pirate Captain Kidd.  He was also known to have created and passed counterfeit money.  His mother, Lucy, was
			very religious and had what some described as &quot;extreme views.&quot;  She was also known to be very superstitious.  When he was
			old enough, Joseph, Jr. joined his father on his treasure hunting expeditions and was in the habit of using &quot;peep stones&quot;
			(i.e., also called &quot;peek stones&quot; -- rocks or crystals from or through which he could allegedly see visions and hidden
			things, much like a crystal ball).  All this is written for the reader to understand some of this cult leader’s background and how
			eventually it came to influence how he founded this false religion.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mormonism got its fledgling start in 1820.  During a spiritual revival in the
			community that year, Joseph was moved by all the excitement but was confused about which church he should join, so he went out in woods to
			pray.  As he was praying he claimed that two “personages” (God the Father and God the Son)  appeared to him and told him not to join any
			church because all of them were false.  When he shared the news of this vision with others he experienced rejection and even persecution.
			Walter Martin notes that shortly thereafter Smith returned to treasure hunting with his father and other dubious activities (<i>Kingdom of
			the Cults</i>, p. 170) which Smith seems to confirm in his own testimony.  It was a few years later before Smith continued in his
			&quot;prophetic calling.&quot; On September 21, 1823, Smith  claimed a spirit calling itself Moroni appeared to him three times while he
			was in bed to reveal God's commission for him to restore the &quot;true&quot; Gospel to the earth.  Moroni also told him of a book of
			golden plates upon which was inscribed the history of the people who had lived in the Americas previously.  Though Smith was told where
			they were located, he was not to go after them until &quot;the time of fulfillment&quot;, which was September 22, 1827.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="mormonphotos/image007.jpg" alt="Smith receiving the Golden Plates"
			width="217" height="288" hspace="10" align="left">After obtaining the plates, Smith began translating them using the &quot;Urim and
			Thummin&quot; which he described as “two stones in silver bows” or, in other words, oversized spectacles through which he could look at
			the plates and see the proper translation.  He claimed that the language on the plates was &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; hieroglyphics.
			He finished in 1829 and the result was the <i>Book of Mormon</i> which was published and copyrighted in 1830.  Later that year on
			April 6 in Fayette, New York, Smith and a handful of men established a new religious organization.  It was first known as the <i>Church
			of Christ</i> but the name later evolved into the <i>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>.  Much of this information can be
			found in Joseph Smith’s Testimony printed in the <i>Pearl of Great Price</i>.  His testimony is also published by the Latter-day Saints
			in pamphlet form.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> As one might expect, these visions, especially the first
				one, are key to the credibility and authority of Joseph Smith in organizing what eventually became the LDS church.  Smith alleges
				that God told him that all churches were rejected as false and was now restoring the &quot;true&quot; church through Smith.  The
				official version of this first vision we now have was written in 1838 and first published in 1842.  However, what many Mormons do
				not know is that there are at least five earlier drafts relating the first vision experience.  They have been suppressed by Mormon
				leadership because they contradict what has become the preferred official position.  Ankerberg and Weldon cite ex-Mormons Jerald
				and Sandra Tanner who say that of all the drafts, this official one is least credible (<i>Cult Watch</i>, pp. 35-36).  Some of the
				discrepancies between the documents include important details like: Smith’s age at the time; the presence (or absence) of an evil
				power there in the woods; Smith’s reason for being out in the woods praying; and how many &quot;personages&quot; actually appeared
				to him.  For example, Smith says the revival which caused him to start seeking after the truth happened in 1820 but other records
				indicate it actually happened in 1824-25.  In one of the other drafts (written in 1835-36) God the Father and Son are not mentioned,
				only many spirits and angels.  Still another says only one personage appeared while the official version says it was two.  All these
				differences in the various accounts of the vision should create doubt in the mind of someone considering the claims of Mormonism.
				One begins to wonder if there was really a vision at all or if Joseph Smith was simply inventing an experience after the fact to
				justify his authority to do what he did when he established the Mormon church.</font></p>

			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For this section I am drawing upon several books, booklets, pamphlets and tracts
					written by those who have either studied Mormonism and witnessed to members extensively or by those who have come out of the LDS
					church to accept Christ.  Since this is a compilation of all their works and many give similar information, I am not going to
					reference each specific point unless it is unique.  Instead I will mention that most of the material comes from the following
					works:  <i>Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Mormons</i> by Ron Rhodes and Marian Bodine; <i>Witness to Mormons</i> by
					Concerned Christians; <i>Why I Left the Mormon Church</i> by Richard D. Baer; and <i>The L.D.S. Gospel in a Nutshell</i> and
					<i>To Dwell with Heavenly Father</i> by Mark Champneys.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many ways for a Christian to witness.  That’s good because each person
					is different and brings his own personality to each encounter with an unbeliever.  Some like to emphasize using God’s word which is
					living and powerful while others favor using analogies and stories (like Jesus) to help the person understand about God and life.
					Some like to simply state the truth and trust the Holy Spirit to convict while others try to build relationships and live out their
					Christianity before their unsaved friends.  Some endeavor to use a combination of some or all.  Besides all that, many Christian
					leaders and/or organizations have developed specific techniques, methods and programs for witnessing which can be studied, practiced
					and used. Many of these ideas are good ones.  There is no such thing as too much preparation for witnessing.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, it must be recognized that not all methods are equally effective all the
					time.  Various types of people with diverse backgrounds may react very differently to one particular style of evangelism.  Some people
					may need to be challenged and confronted about their guilt before God while others respond more favorably to a message of God’s love
					and grace.  This often depends upon the stage of &quot;soil preparation&quot; of that person’s heart.  Is it time for plowing,
					planting, watering or reaping?  The point I’m trying to make is that different situations may call for different approaches in
					presenting Jesus.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With regard to Mormons, especially those who are active in the organization, those
					who are practiced in witnessing to them all say pretty much the same thing which is:  In most cases, it’s going to take an investment
					of time and a demonstration of love to make a difference.  To understand why this is so, we need to see where the Latter-day Saint
					is coming from.  Many Mormons have been raised up in the LDS church.  They have been indoctrinated since childhood about Joseph
					Smith and LDS teachings.  They have been taught that they are the only true church and other &quot;so-called&quot; Christian churches
					are false and deceptive.  They have been told that their only hope of dwelling with Heavenly Father is to strictly adhere to all these
					teachings.  Furthermore, and perhaps most significantly, they understand that if they leave the LDS church for mainstream Christianity,
					they will be rejected by their friends and family who remain faithful to Mormonism.  This phenomenon is not unusual among Christian
					cults and non-Christian religions and societies.  To forsake one’s upbringing, underpinnings and associations is no light, easy
					decision. In fact, it is a major barrier to the acceptance of the gospel because the price is so high.  Yet Jesus said that such
					would be the case and that very often extremely hard choices would have to be made in order to follow Him (<b>cf. Matthew 10:32-39;
					John 15:18-21</b>). If you as a believer were raised in a Christian home or even in a family that does not write you off just
					because of your faith, you should thank the Lord for that precious blessing.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These factors have ramifications.  For one thing, it is extremely unusual, if not
					completely unheard of, for a devoted Mormon to come to faith in Christ after just one or two exchanges or conversations with a
					Christian.  For those who do convert it involves a process, perhaps lengthy, of hearing the truth, coming to doubt the teachings of
					Smith and the Mormon organization, and being convinced that following Christ is worth the cost.  There is a lot of teaching, training
					and tradition to overcome in his life.  To win a Mormon to Christ it may be that you will have to invest much time with him or her.
					Of course it may be this process that an individual Mormon goes through, though lengthy for him, involves a series of meetings with
					different Christians.  I am not saying that if you communicate with a Mormon you must commit to spending several hours with him or her
					before ever mentioning the true Gospel.  It may be that the contact for you in such an instance is short but the Holy Spirit uses your
					words in conjunction with the efforts of others to convict this person of the truth.  Obviously, in many cases we only meet and
					interact with people briefly yet we should seek to testify for Christ and leave a positive impression about Him for the next
					Christian who crosses his or her path to then build upon.  However, we must also be willing to give sufficient time to people who
					need it when it seems they have been placed in our sphere of influence by the Lord.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Mormon’s life situation also affects the way we should communicate with him.
					We <b>must not</b> leave him with the idea that the typical Christian is condescending or critical or cold toward him despite the
					fact that we disagree with his doctrine.  This is sometimes a challenge.  For Christians who see the obvious weaknesses and
					fallacies of Mormonism it is easy to assume an attitude of amazement at how gullible otherwise intelligent people can be about
					their religion.  That sort of attitude can be very offensive to the person at whom it is directed.  Many in secular society feel
					the same way about believers in Christ and those Christians who have been mocked or held in contempt (even when it’s not overt)
					because of their faith understand that it is not pleasant and often seek to avoid contact with those who do the mocking.  The same
					is true with Mormons.  If you show a smug superiority toward them you will likely not have a chance to speak with them again.
					Undue criticism is likewise a killer in this endeavor.  While we have sought to expose the issues and inform the Christian believer
					in this study, the information is not given so that we can &quot;blast away with both barrels&quot; at the next young Mormon
					missionary who shows up at our doors or any other Mormon acquaintances.  This, too, will result in them avoiding you.  Believe it
					or not, they can detect when people are cold toward them (just like you can).  We must recognize that they get a <b>lot</b> of
					negative reactions from people as they go door to door, as they speak of their faith and as they practice their faith which often
					requires things of them that outsiders do not understand.  Though they may chalk it up to the &quot;persecution of the
					righteous,&quot; as human beings, they get weary of this and take refuge in the sanctuary of their organization -- which is the
					last thing we want them to do.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To combat this and encourage open, honest discussion, we must demonstrate
					genuine kindness, compassion and love toward them.  One writer suggests that though they do seek comfort from those who share
					their beliefs, this only goes so far because there is a barrier that hinders Mormons from being very transparent with each other.
					Because perfection in obedience to the Mormon teachings is the goal, they do not have the freedom to confide in each other about
					doubts and problems.  To do so would indicate a lack of faith or that the religion is not working for them.  He writes, &quot;<i>You
					can be the best friend a Mormon woman or man ever had if you will love them enough so that they can be open with you.</i>&quot;
					(<i>Witness to Mormons</i>, p. 2.) Indeed, if we do not show compassion and love to them, what incentive do they have to abandon
					their friends and family to follow Jesus?  They must see that they can find acceptance somewhere else besides the LDS church.
					</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that we have been reminded of the dilemma a Mormon is in regarding his
					involvement with the Latter-day Saints  and have seen that the basic attitude we must show is that of patience and love, let us
					consider some basic &quot;Do’s&quot; and &quot;Don’ts&quot; we should observe when witnessing to Mormons.  Some of these are very
					similar to the ones we saw in the study of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.  That is to be expected because, even though many of the
					doctrinal errors and issues of these two perversions of Christianity are different, people are people and most people respond
					favorably to basic principles of interaction (such as courtesy and kindness as we have already discussed).</font></p>

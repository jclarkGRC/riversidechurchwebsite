				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, some <b><i>&quot;Don'ts&quot;:</i></b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. <b>Don't get distracted with minor issues.</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though it is tempting to attack their religion by impugning the character of
					Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, etc. (personal experience reveals that they merely bring up the imperfections of many of the heroes
					of the Bible or of present day Christian leaders/celebrities); or by pointing out some of the obviously absurd statements and
					prophecies of Smith and subsequent Mormon leaders that we have seen (remember they believe modern prophecy supersedes older
					prophecy);  or even by bringing up their views on things like eternal progression, heaven, hell, spirit prison, etc. and point
					out the internal inconsistencies and the incompatibility of these teachings with the Bible (remember, to them the Bible is valid
					only &quot;<i>as far as it translated correctly</i>&quot; -- <i>Article of Faith</i> #8), it is likely that approaches like these
					will fall on deaf ears.  Remember, they come into the encounter not trusting you as a Christian and skeptical of what you may say.
					They will usually pay little heed to your absolute statements even though they may be absolutely true.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2. Don't try to cover too much ground in one conversation.</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This goes hand in hand with number one.  Sometimes an encounter between an
					informed Christian and a cult member deteriorates into a series of  debates about a multitude of issues.  Even if you have a willing listener, trying to stuff in too much information may be counterproductive.  Further, the effort to win the debate with an argumentative Mormon can become a distraction from the primary purpose of witnessing for Jesus.  We have already mentioned the negative effects of blasting away at their teachings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>3. Don't assume that
          the Mormon you're talking to is aware of or believes all the things
          that the organization officially teaches.</strong></font></p> <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two main aspects to this.  First, if you boldly assert that the LDS church teaches something that this particular Mormon does not recognize or acknowledge as true (for whatever reason) and you cannot document it to his satisfaction, he may assume you are either hostile or ignorant or perhaps both.  This would likely lead to a loss of credibility which would damage your witness.  Second, if you start telling the Mormon what he believes (because of your study) it is likely he will take offense at your presumption.  Few people like to be unconditionally labeled and lumped in with whatever group they might be a part of.  We like to think of ourselves as individuals with our own thoughts and identities.  There is great diversity among true Christians.  The same things are true for Mormons.  You are not dealing with the whole organization--you are dealing with an individual.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>4.
          Don't use another version of the Bible besides the King James with
          a Mormon when discussing the scriptures.</strong></font></p> <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He will not acknowledge the          authority of any other version or translation.  With the King James at least he must give some recognition of its legitimacy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>5. Don't
          allow the use of the Mormon standard works.</strong></font></p> <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just because you are attempting to be courteous and kind doesn’t mean you can’t have input into the parameters of your discussion.  Tell him that you want to stick with what the Bible says about Jesus and salvation.  He should agree to this since they publicly affirm the value of the Bible in order to appear as mainstream Christians.  One major difference between Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses, at least in my opinion, is that the JW’s are more likely to twist and obscure Bible passages to defend their views while the Mormons are more likely to simply say the Bible is wrong (“corrupted”) and revert to the Book of Mormon or Doctrine and Covenants for their teachings.  That is not to say Mormons never try to manipulate the Scriptures but it is usually easier to pick up on the error by examining the context or comparing other passages.  Hopefully, as the Latter-day Saint examines what God’s living and powerful Word says about various subjects, it will convict him.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NOTE:  There is an exception to this rule of not using the Mormon sources of authority--in many cases, as we have seen, the Mormon standard works contradict each other.  It may be useful to point out some of these things in the course of the conversation in order to create doubt in the Mormon’s mind.</font></p>

			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>D. About the Priesthood and the Living Prophets</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Almost from the beginning the Mormon church has professed to possess something
					that no other church or denomination has ever claimed -- namely the <b>Aaronic</b> (Levitical) and <b>Melchizedek</b> priesthoods.
					According to Smith on May 15, 1829, Peter, James and John sent John the Baptist to officially confer the Aaronic priesthood upon
					Oliver Cowdery and himself (<i>Pearl of Great Price</i>, Joseph Smith 2:68-73).  Not too long after that (probably before June 30,
					1829), the same three apostles showed up in person to further bestow the Melchizedek priesthood upon these two men (John A.
					Widtsoe, <i>The Priesthood and Church Government</i>,  p. 107 cited by Walter Martin, <i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 195).
					What difference does all this make?  A <b>lot</b> as we shall see.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. The Function of the Priesthood in the Mormon church:</strong></font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. In their view, although there are two <i>divisions</i> to the priesthood,
						they are considered to be but <b>one</b>.  The Melchizedek embraces or comprehends the Aaronic (<i>Doctrine and Covenants</i>
						107:1-6).  Although perhaps not a perfect analogy, for our purposes we might compare it to a boy starting as a Cub Scout,
						progressing to Boy Scout and then on to be an Eagle Scout.  They are different entities and ranks but one overall program of
						Scouting. Just so, a young man starts out by having the Aaronic priesthood conferred upon him and then later is given the
						Melchizedek along with greater authority and privileges. (See Rhodes and Bodine, <i>Reasoning from the Scriptures with the
						Mormons</i>, p. 202 for a listing of the various stages and offices.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. Only through the authority of this priesthood can men speak and act in
						the name of the Lord for the salvation of humanity.  It is &quot;<i>the channel through which all knowledge, doctrine, the
						plan of salvation, and every important matter is revealed from heaven.</i>&quot; (Widtsoe, pp. 102-03 cited by Martin, pp.
						195-96; cf. <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> 84:19-22.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. The &quot;<i>Priesthood is designed to assist men in all of life's
						endeavors, both temporal and spiritual.</i>&quot; (Ibid.)   In other words, this priesthood (or rather the offices therein --
						presidents, apostles, high priests, the seventies, elders, etc.) influences or controls all phases of Mormon life.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">d. The ultimate salvation of a man depends upon his possession of the
						Melchizedek priesthood. Thus virtually every Mormon male above the age of twelve is involved in the priesthood to some degree
						or other.  Since women are not allowed to have the priesthood conferred upon them this explains why a wife is dependent
						upon her husband for her own salvation.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">e. Since no other church has received this priesthood or even claims to
						have received it, this is the underlying reason that Mormons say that they are the only true church now in existence.  Bruce
						McConkie, in his book <i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, states,  &quot;<i>Thus, as far as all religious organizations now existing are
						concerned, the presence or the absence of this priesthood establishes the divinity or the falsity of a professing church. ...
						If there is no Melchizedek priesthood on earth, the true church is not here and the gospel of Christ is not available to men.
						But where the Melchizedek priesthood is, there is the kingdom, the Church, and the fulness of the gospel.</i>&quot;
						(pp. 480-81.)</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We conclude then that the doctrine and practice of the priesthood is of primary
					importance to Mormons.  Walter Martin asserts that if this belief can be refuted it would strike at the &quot;<i>very foundations
					of Mormonism.</i>&quot; (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 196.)  Let us then refute it.  <b>Hebrews 6:20-7:20</b> sheds much light
					on this issue.</font></p>
				<p><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The Falsehood of the Priesthood in the Mormon church:</font></strong></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. First, we see in the Scriptures that the Melchizedek priesthood is
						<b>not</b> an expansion or a furtherance of the Aaronic priesthood, but something completely different.</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) It was a superior priesthood -- <b>cf. Hebrews 7:4, 7, 9-10.</b>
							Notice they are not of the same character in being merely different divisions based on achievement or advancement.  Abraham
							recognizes the vast superiority of Melchizedek when he paid tithes to him (<b>cf. Genesis 14:18-20</b>) and represented
							the tribe of Levi yet to be born.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) The Aaronic (Levitical) priesthood was insufficient for man's
							salvation so &quot;<b><i>another</b> priest</i>&quot; (7:11) arose.  In other words, again, it was not simply part of a
							natural progression, as a boy becoming a man, but rather something of a completely different nature.</font></p>
						<blockquote>
							<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TODAY'S GREEK LESSON:</b> According to W.E. Vine, there are two
								words in Greek for &quot;<i>another.</i>&quot;   One is <i>allos</i> which indicates a numerical (quantitative)
								difference and refers to another of the same sort, e.g., &quot;<i>Yet another person has shown up late.</i>&quot;
								The other is <i>heteros</i> which refers to a qualitative difference indicating a completely different nature, e.g.,
								&quot;<i>Here’s another idea, instead of doing that, let’s ...</i>&quot;  The word used in Hebrews 7:11 is, of course,
								<i>heteros</i>.  The Melchizedek priesthood is of a fundamentally different nature than the Levitical (Aaronic)
								priesthood.</font></p>
						</blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) The Levitical priesthood did not evolve but was
							&quot;<b><i>changed</i></b>&quot; (7:12).  This is evidenced by the tearing of the veil in the temple at the death of Christ
							(<b>cf. Matthew 27:51</b>). The tearing of the veil symbolized a new access to God for everyone based on the work of Christ.
							No longer does a person need some other person to intercede for him to God. Each person can approach God through Jesus.  The
							Levitical system was <i>replaced</i> by something better.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) Finally, the Aaronic priesthood was an exclusive possession of Aaron’s
							descendants who were of the tribe of Levi (<b>cf. Exodus 29:4-9; Deuteronomy 10:8</b>).  No other Israelites could be
							priests.  Jesus became a priest after the order of Melchizedek, but He was of the tribe of Judah
							(<b>cf. Hebrews 7:13-14</b>).</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>SO:</b> When the Mormons say they possess the Aaronic or Levitical
							priesthood, which is a part of the priesthood of Melchizedek they make two mistakes.  First, they err in that the two are
							completely separate and utterly different. Also they are actually claiming a priesthood that in God's eyes was canceled or
							done away with at Calvary.  It has no more effectiveness or power, or even a place, in God’s economy.</font></p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. Second, we see the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek is only
						held by one Person.</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) The Bible clearly states that Jesus became a priest after the order
							of Melchizedek (<b>cf. Hebrews 6:20</b>), which, as we have seen, is a superior priesthood.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) Another proof of this superiority is the fact that it  is
							&quot;<b><i>forever&quot;, &quot;continual&quot;, &quot;endless&quot;</i> (cf. 6:20; 7:3, 16-17)</b>.  In the old system
							priests died and had to be replaced (<b>cf. 7:23</b>).  But Jesus, being very God, is able to continue forever.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) Because He is able to continue forever His priesthood is
							&quot;<b><i>unchangeable</i></b>&quot; or as Walter Martin says <i>untransferable</i> (<i>Kingdom</i>, p. 198).  A.T.
							Robertson writes, &quot;<i>God placed Jesus in this priesthood and no one else can step into it.</i>&quot; (<i>Word
							Pictures in the New Testamant</i>, vol. 5, p. 386.)  No one else is uniquely qualified to be High Priest after the order
							of Melchizedek as Jesus is.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b> Mormons claim that Melchizedek conferred his priesthood
							on Abraham (<i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> 84:14) when Abraham paid tithes to him after the rescue of Lot as recorded in
							Genesis 14:8-20.  For them this is proof that more than one can hold this priesthood.  The problem with that theory is
							there is no support for that in the Genesis account.  It is without either basis or merit.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>SO:</b> When Joseph Smith claimed that the Melchizedek priesthood
							was passed to him and his followers, he was mistaken (at least according to the Bible!).  The priesthood after the order
							of Melchizedek is the sole possession of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having seen these biblical truths we conclude then that the LDS idea of
						what constitutes the priesthood of believers and who possesses it is an absolute falsehood.  Their belief has no support from
						the Scriptures and, in fact, is contradicted and refuted by the Bible.  But now we must ask:  <i><b>Is</b> there a priesthood
						which believers should possess according to the Bible?</i>  Let’s see.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. <b>The true (and only) priesthood which exists resides in Christ's
					church:</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mormons believe the Christian church is apostate and are not hesitant at all
					about proselytizing its members.  One of their favorite tactics is to claim that the Christian does not have the priesthood.
					But, as we have seen, the priesthood they claim to have is completely false.  Further, Christians do not have to be defensive
					because in reality we have the only legitimate priesthood which exists according to the Bible.  See <b>Revelation 1:4-6</b>
					and <b>I Peter 2:9</b>.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>PLEASE UNDERSTAND:</b> A &quot;<b>priest</b>&quot; is someone who stands
					between you and God making intercession for you.  Jesus has become that High Priest who has provided a way for each of us to
					approach God ourselves (<b>I Timothy 2:5-6; Hebrews 4:14-16; 10:19-22</b>). There are more priests just in one church than in
					the whole membership of the Mormon organization.  We do not need temples, secret ceremonies, rituals, special offices or
					mysterious services.  Our priesthood comes from simple childlike faith that enables us to talk with God who comes to dwell in
					us when we truly believe in Jesus for salvation.</font></p>
				<p><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. The Living Prophets</font></strong></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles is also known as the
					&quot;living prophet&quot; (head of the church).  From Joseph Smith to Brigham Young and on to the present day, there has
					allegedly been an unbroken chain of these &quot;prophets.&quot;  To say their role in the Mormon movement is important would
					be an understatement.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>- &quot;<i>Where there are no apostles and prophets
						there is no divine Church, but where these officers are found, there is the Church of Christ in all its glory, beauty, and
						perfection.</i>&quot;  (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, pp. 606-07.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Ezra Taft Benson</b>- &quot;<i>The Prophet is the only man who speaks
					for the Lord in everything. ... The living prophet is more vital to us than the standard works. ... The living Prophet is more
					important to us than a dead prophet</i>.&quot;  (From a speech entitled &quot;<i>The Fourteen Fundamentals of a Prophet</i>&quot;
					given at Brigham Young University on February 26, 1980.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c.  <b>Bruce McConkie</b>- &quot;<i>Any new revelation for the Church would,
						of course, be presented to the people by the President of the Church, he being the mouthpiece of God on earth</i>.&quot;
						(<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, p. 606.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">d. <b>Brigham Young</b>- &quot;<i>I have never yet preached a sermon and sent
						it out to the children of men, that they might not call it Scripture</i>.” (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, vol. 13, p. 95.)
						&quot;<i>I say now, when they (my sermons) are copied and approved by me they are as good Scripture as is couched in this Bible,
						and if you want to read revelation read the sayings of him who knows the mind of God</i>.”  (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>,
						vol. 13, p. 254.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">e. <b>Wilford Woodruff</b>- &quot;<i>The Lord will never permit me or any other
						man who stands as President of this Church to lead you astray.  It is not in the programme</i>.”  (Part of the Official
						Declaration given in 1889 regarding the practice of polygamy as published in the <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i>, 1981
						edition.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">f.  <b>Ward teachers instruction</b>-  &quot;<i>Any Latter-day Saint who
						denounces or opposes, whether actively or otherwise, any plan or doctrine advocated by the 'prophets, seers, and revelators'
						of the Church is cultivating the spirit of apostasy. ... Lucifer ... wins a great victory when he can get members of the
						Church to speak against their leaders and 'do their own thinking.' ... When our leaders speak, the thinking has been done.
						When they propose a plan -- it is God's plan. When they point the way, there is no other way which is safe.  When they give
						direction, it should mark the end of controversy</i>.&quot;  (<i>Improvement Era</i>,  June 1945, p. 354.)</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We see several things from these statements:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.  As with their claim to being the sole possessor of the priesthood,
						Mormons also teach that they alone have the offices of apostles and prophets.  Using <b>Amos 3:7</b> they try to argue that
						there must be a true prophet on earth else we could not know God’s will.  As usual an examination of the context
						(<b>vv. 1-8</b>) defeats this contention.  Amos is telling Israel about impending judgment from God.  True to his merciful
						nature, God does not just let it happen but warns Israel through His prophet.  He uses a series of rhetorical questions to
						show them how certain and serious this judgment is.  The verse relates to how God interacts with Israel and the big events
						in her history, such as this judgment.  It has <b><i>nothing</i></b> to do with the necessity of there being a true prophet
						so that people can hear the truth about God.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.  They teach that the Mormon organization is supernaturally led by
						prophetic revelation. Again they would claim that this is unique to the Latter-day Saints.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.  This alleged revelation is the primary source of authority for the
						Latter-day Saints.  It supersedes the Standard Works and newer prophecy is superior to past prophecy.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4.  Mormons are taught to obey the teachings of their leaders
						unquestioningly based on the inerrant nature of these prophecies.  The authority of the President of the Church and the other
						leaders are equated with the authority of God Himself.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b>  Such claims of authority and total control over the membership
					by the leaders of a group is a classic characteristic of a cult.  It is maintained by the members’ fear of losing what the cult
					claims to be able to provide.  The pertinent question is whether or not the Mormons truly possess God’s authority as evidenced
					by their prophetic utterances.  Joseph Fielding Smith writes, &quot;<i>[Mormonism] must stand or fall on the story of Joseph Smith.
					He was either a true prophet of God -- divinely called, properly appointed and commissioned -- or he was one of the biggest
					frauds this world has ever seen. There is no middle ground</i>.&quot; (<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>, vol. 1, p. 188.)  The test
					of a prophet is if what he says actually comes to pass -- <b>Deuteronomy 18:21-22</b>.  The Mormons agree with that standard.
					Joseph Smith wrote, &quot;<i>When therefore, any man, no matter who, or how high his standing may be, utters, or publishes anything
					that afterwards proves to be untrue, he is a false prophet</i>.&quot; (<i>The Evening and Morning Star</i>, July 1833, p. 1.)
					</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>So when we look at their prophetic record what do we find?</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a previous discussion about one of their sources of authority, <i>Doctrine and
					Covenants</i>, we have already mentioned two incorrect prophecies.  One was about Smith &quot;prophesying&quot; the outbreak of the
					Civil War in <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> 87:1-8.  We gave enough attention to that one (for more information on this and many
					more false prophecies see Jerald and Sandra Tanner's <i>Major Problems of Mormonism</i>, pp. 92-105; also Ankerberg and Weldon’s
					<i>Cult Watch</i>, pp. 42-43.)</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are a few more details about the other one we mentioned:</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">** On September 22-23, 1832, Smith allegedly received a revelation that both a
					city and a temple were to be built &quot;<i>in the Western boundaries of the State of Missouri.</i>&quot;  This is recorded in
					<i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> 84:1-5,31.  Furthermore, &quot;<i>this generation</i> (Smith's) <i>shall not pass away</i>&quot;
					before it was to be built and it would be dedicated by Smith himself.  In 1864, Apostle George Cannon reiterated it.  (<i>Journal
					of Discourses</i>, vol. 10, p. 344.)  In 1870, Orson Pratt continued to insist that it would come to pass because &quot;<i>God
					promised it</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>God cannot lie</i>.&quot; (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, vol. 13, p.  362.)   In 1900, Lorenzo
					Snow also confirmed it and said that the Mormons living in Utah would soon go back and build their temple. (<i>Dialogue: A Journal
					of Mormon Thought</i>, Autumn 1966, p. 74.) In 1931, Joseph Fielding Smith stated his &quot;<i>firm belief</i>&quot; that the
					temple would be built. (<i>The Way to Perfection</i>, 1935 ed., p. 270.)  It is now over 170 years and four generations later.
					There is yet to be a Mormon temple built in Jackson County, Missouri.  So Joseph Smith and many of his supposed prophetic
					successors proved to be false by predicting a thing that did not come to pass.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In their book, <i>Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Mormons</i> (pp. 68-70),
					Ron Rhodes and Marian Bodine reveal a few other gems.  For instance, Joseph Smith in his work, <i>History of the Church of Jesus
					Christ of Latter-day Saints</i>, wrote, &quot;<i>I prophesy in the name of the Lord God of Israel, unless the United States
					redress the wrongs committed upon the Saints in the state of Missouri and punish the crimes committed by her officers that in
					a few years the government will be utterly overthrown and wasted, and there will not be so much as a potsherd left, for their
					wickedness in permitting the murder of men, women, and children.</i>&quot; (vol. 5, p. 394.)</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can also see that Smith’s god is not only liable to mistake about future
					events but can also be fooled about the character of a man.  On January 19, 1841, the Lord gave Smith insight about John C.
					Bennett.  In <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> 124:16-17 God praises this &quot;<i>servant</i>&quot; for his &quot;<i>love</i>&quot;
					and promises to bless him.  In a letter dated June 24, 1842, Smith wrote that Bennett’s &quot;<i>general character is that of an
					adulterer of the worst kind,...</i>&quot; (<i>History of the Church</i>, vol. 5, p. 42).  Smith also admitted that the behavior
					had been going on even at the time of the positive &quot;revelation&quot; about Bennett and that he had received the man into
					fellowship despite having been warned about his immoral ways by others.  Apparently Smith and his god were both duped.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brigham Young (whose every sermon was to be considered the very word of God)
					was also not above error.  He stated of the Civil War that it would fail to emancipate the slaves. &quot;<i>Will the present
					struggle free the slave?  No; but they are now wasting away the black race by thousands.</i>&quot; (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>,
					vol. 10, p. 250.)  He also spoke this profound thought: &quot;<i>Who can tell us of the inhabitants of this little planet that
					shines of an evening, called the moon? ...When you inquire about the inhabitants of that sphere you find that the most learned
					are as ignorant in regard to them as the most ignorant of their fellows.  So it is with regard to the inhabitants of the sun.
					Do you think it is inhabited? I rather think it is.  Do you think there is any life there? No question of it; it was not made
					in vain</i>.&quot; (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, vol. 13, p. 271.)</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bottom line is that every mortal man is subject to error and eventually
					will think and say things that are incorrect.  But God is never wrong.  <b>II Peter 1:19-21</b> tells us the true source of
					real prophecy.  Thus, according to the biblical standard we have seen, true prophecy is <b>never</b> in error.  We have seen
					undeniable proof that, <i>in their prophetic utterances</i> and not just in everyday life, the prophets of Mormonism have been
					woefully wrong with regard to what was and what was to come.  The undeniable conclusion is that they were and are false prophets
					who proclaim a false doctrine.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Summing up this section:  There are two things the Latter-day Saints claim
				to possess exclusively -- the priesthood and the living prophet.  When examined in the light of Scripture and their own recorded
				words, both fail the test of authenticity.  The Mormon movement has no credibility nor does it have the truth.  It is leading its
				adherents to death.</b></font></p>

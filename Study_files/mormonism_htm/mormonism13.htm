				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already seen that The Latter-day Saints believe that at death a
					person’s spirit goes either to paradise or a spirit prison to await the day of final judgment.  While they are waiting the
					ones in paradise may share the teachings of Joseph Smith with the ones in prison.  The ones in prison may accept these teachings
					and leave if someone has been baptized on their behalf on earth.  In this way they may improve their lot in the final judgment
					by beginning to work on their own progression (See <i>Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Mormons</i> by Rhodes and Bodine,
					pp. 351-52.)  What we want to consider now is what happens to various groups of people <b>after</b> the day of final judgment.

				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>** Supporting evidence and quotations of what Mormons really believe:</b>
					</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. There are <b>three kingdoms</b> or levels of heaven.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b><i>Doctrine and Covenants 76:89-92</i></b>-- &quot;<i>And thus we saw,
						in the heavenly vision, the glory of the telestial, which surpasses all understanding; And no man knows it except him to
						whom God has revealed it.  And thus we saw the glory of the terrestrial which excels in all things the glory of the telestial,
						even in glory, and in power, and in might, and in dominion.  And thus we saw the glory of the celestial, which excels in all
						things -- where God, even the Father, reigns upon his throne forever and ever;</i>&quot;</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FYI:  This section of <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> is an alleged
							vision given to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon at Hiram, Ohio on February 16, 1832.  It is 119 verses long and goes
							into much detail concerning the three kingdoms and the qualifications required for each.  It also reveals the fate of
							those who are the &quot;sons of perdition.&quot;</font></p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Joseph Smith</b>-- &quot;<i>Except a  man be born again, he cannot see
						the Kingdom of God ... A man may be saved, after the judgment, in the terrestrial kingdom, or in the telestial kingdom, but
						he can never see the celestial kingdom of God, without being born of water and the Spirit.</i>&quot;  (<i>History of the
						Church</i>, vol. 1, p. 283.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>LeGrand Richards</b>-- &quot;<i>One of the greatest errors in the
						teachings of the Christian religions is the doctrine of one heaven and one hell, so that all who go to heaven share and
						share alike, and all who fail to go to heaven are sent to hell where they share and share alike.</i>&quot;  (<i>A Marvelous
						Work and a Wonder</i>, p. 253.)</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b> This is not a teaching that most Mormons would avoid or
							deny even though it is incompatible with biblical teaching.  However, they might not want to make this part of an initial
							discussion with a potential prospect  because it is somewhat complicated and confusing compared to the familiar Christian
							doctrine of one heaven and one hell.  Besides the <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> passage, Mormons like to use
							<b>I Corinthians 15:40-42</b> to seek to prove their contention that there is more than one final place of abode after death
							and the judgment.  In the same work referenced above, LeGrand Richards writes: &quot;<i>There is a glory of the sun, or
							celestial glory; another glory like the moon, or the terrestrial glory; and another glory like the stars, or, as we will
							learn, the telestial glory; and 'since one star differeth from another star in glory,' so also 'is the resurrection of the
							dead.' From this we learn that the great multitude in the resurrection will be likened unto the stars in heaven; and just
							as their works have differed in importance and faithfulness here upon the earth, so also shall their condition in the
							resurrection differ, even as the stars in heaven differ in glory.</i>&quot;</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are a few problems with their interpretation of this passage.  Both
							Rhodes and Bodine in <i>Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Mormons</i> (pp. 379-80) and Jerald and Sandra Tanner in
							<i>Major Problems of Mormonism</i> (p.  208) point out the following discrepancies:  1)  The word &quot;<i>telestial</i>&quot;
							is not in the passage at all.  It is a word made up by Smith and illicitly connected to these verses.  Mormons are reading
							something into the passage that is not there and not even implied;  2)  The words &quot;<i>celestial</i>&quot; and
							&quot;<i>terrestrial</i>&quot; respectively mean &quot;<i>heavenly</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>earthly</i>.&quot;  Paul was
							using the words to draw a contrast between that which is <b>earthly</b> (our present existence and experience) and that
							which is <b>heavenly</b> (the future glory of heaven which we cannot begin to imagine). So once again he is not referring
							to different kingdoms;  3) The context is made clear in <b>v. 35</b> in which Paul poses the anticipated questions of
							&quot;<i>How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?</i>&quot;  Thus we see that Paul is <b>not</b>
							talking about different kingdoms but rather about the difference in the sort of body people have now and the heavenly
							body those who are saved will possess in the future.  The latter part of <b>v. 42</b> drives this home <b>&quot;The body is
							sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.&quot;</b></font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another passage used by the Latter-day Saints with regard to their view
							of heaven is <b>II Corinthians 12:2</b>.  They contend that there cannot be a third heaven unless there is a first and
							second.  However, this &quot;logic&quot; is misguided.  Jews commonly spoke of  three heavens by which they meant: 1)
							The atmosphere around the earth we usually refer to as the &quot;sky&quot;;  2)  The expanse beyond the sky which contains
							the sun, moon, planets and stars or what is often called &quot;outer space&quot;;  3)  The abode of God.  To read Mormon
							theology into Paul’s terminology is to ignore the historical mindset and the common use of language among the Jews.<

				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.  The three kingdoms will include almost <b>everyone</b>.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Joseph Fielding Smith</b>-- &quot;<i>Those who reject the gospel, but live
						honorable lives, shall also be heirs of salvation, but not in the celestial kingdom.  The Lord has prepared a place for them
						in the terrestrial kingdom.  Those who live lives of wickedness may also be heirs of salvation, that is, they too shall be
						redeemed from death and from hell eventually.</i>&quot;  (<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>, vol. 2, p. 133.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>John Widtsoe</b>-- &quot;<i>Very few will be so condemned as sons of
						perdition ... [because] ... very few have the knowledge required.  All others, who are not classed as sons of perdition, will
						be 'redeemed in the due time of the Lord'; that is they will all be saved.  The meanest sinner will find some place in the
						heavenly realm.</i>&quot; (<i>Joseph Smith -- Seeker After Truth</i>, p. 177.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>-- &quot; <i>... contrary to the views found in the
					uninspired teachings and creeds of modern Christendom, there are in eternity kingdoms of glory to which all resurrected persons
					(except the sons of perdition) will eventually go.</i>&quot; (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, p. 420.)</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FYI:</b> The diagram from <i>Major Problems of Mormonism</i> by Jerald and
					Sandra Tanner provides a good overview of the whole Mormon idea of eternal progression.  For our purposes here, consider the
					three kingdoms and whom they include.  Starting at the top we see that the BI kingdom is comprised of Mormons in good standing
					and children who die before age eight.  However, even here there is a difference made in those who were in &quot;<i>complete
					obedience</i>&quot; and those who did not quite measure up which is demonstrated in this kingdom being itself divided into three
					parts.  While we don’t know exactly what the criteria for the middle level is, the key to entering the top level and thus being
					eligible for eventual exaltation (godhood and your very own world) seems to be having a marriage which is sealed in a Mormon temple.
					Those who do not are consigned to the bottom level (or perhaps the middle--who knows?).  It is important to note that in Mormon
					thinking only the top level of the celestial kingdom is regarded as &quot;<i>full salvation.</i>&quot;  This is the only part of
					the three kingdoms where a man may continue to be married and produce spirit children, populate his world, etc. This kingdom is
					where Elohim (the Father) resides and rules.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b><i>terrestrial</i></b> kingdom mainly consists of people who were
					&quot;moral&quot; or &quot;honorable&quot; for the most part but did not accept the Mormon faith (such as good Christians and
					those of other religions but also including those who never heard the &quot;true gospel&quot; of Mormonism).  Also those who
					wait until after death and accept Mormonism in the spirit prison will be here.  Finally, some Mormons who were not
					&quot;valiant&quot; but instead were &quot;lukewarm&quot; may be surprised to find they do not merit the top kingdom but are
					instead relegated to this level.  According to Mark Champneys in <i>Christianity Re-Defined by Mormonism</i>, Jehovah (or
					Jesus) resides and rules in the terrestrial kingdom (though other sources say Jesus is in the Celestial).</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are among the vast majority of the world’s wicked population -- you
					live with no regard for what’s right, good and kind, neither do you fear God but rather only indulge your selfish, carnal appetites
					-- you will end up in the <b><i>telestial</i></b> kingdom.  Those who are destined for this lowest level will probably have to
					endure some time in a place of torment to make up for their evil conduct.  Champneys comments that the Holy Spirit resides and
					rules here in a place that is &quot;<i>still far more wonderful than earth</i>&quot; (to say nothing of what hell would be
					like).</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bottom line is that almost everyone will find a place in one of the three
					kingdoms.  We might say that the average Mormon believes in a <b><i>universal</i></b> salvation for all men.  Indeed, they
					themselves say this as R.H. Evans who proclaimed, &quot;<i>Mormons believe in universal salvation that all men will be saved, but
					each to his own order.</i>&quot; (<i>Look</i> magazine, Oct. 5, 1954.)  Thus, while only the cream of the crop will attain to the
					top level of the celestial kingdom, almost everyone else will receive a pleasant existence as a servant in one of the lesser
					kingdoms (though sometimes these who are in lesser, serving roles are said by Mormons to be &quot;<i>damned</i>,&quot; especially
					those in the telestial kingdom).</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mormons like to belittle the fact that Christians teach that all believers
					will inherit the same kingdom.  They argue against the idea that all should receive the same inheritance when some are much
					more faithful than others.  This is a misconception based on an incomplete knowledge of what most Christians believe.  Walter
					Martin (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 217) points out that indeed we declare that all genuine believers will enter into the
					one kingdom of God which is the &quot;<i>base pay</i>&quot; described in the parable of the laborers in <b>Matthew 20:1-16</b>.
					Eternal life in God’s kingdom will be received by all who genuinely believe no matter at what time of life or the amount of
					work they do for the Lord.  Martin points to Jesus’ promise to the thief on the cross next to Him as evidence of that principle
					(<b>Luke 23:42-43</b>).  Other scripture passages to consider which teach that there is only one kingdom where all believers go
					to be with the Lord are: <b>Matthew 25:29; John 12:25-26; I Thessalonians 2:12; Hebrews 12:28; James 2:5</b>.  Besides these there
					are a multitude of references to both the &quot;<b><i>kingdom of God</i></b>&quot; and the &quot;<b><i>kingdom of
					heaven</i></b>.&quot; These references are always singular, never plural.  There is no support for multiple kingdoms in the Bible.
					Incidentally, once more as in other cases, their own <i>Book of Mormon</i> does not support the idea either.  Nowhere in their
					primary source of authority is this doctrine taught.  The &quot;later vision&quot; recorded in <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> 76
					is the sole basis for this belief.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With regard to those who are longtime, faithful servants versus those who are
					not as faithful, Mormons fail to consider the biblical teaching of rewards in heaven.  In <b>I Corinthians 3:11-15</b> and
					<b>II Corinthians 5:10</b> Paul teaches that believers will be judged according to how they have served and will be rewarded
					accordingly.  Jesus also in His parable of the talents (<b>Matthew 25:14-29</b>) and of the minas (<b>Luke 19:11-24</b>) seems
					to be teaching that His people will be given rewards and responsibilities according to their service and faithfulness while
					waiting for His return.  The Bible also teaches the concept of degrees of punishment in hell (<b>cf. Matthew 10:15; 11:21-24;
					Luke 12:47-48</b>), which brings us to the last point. </font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.  There is <b>no eternal hell</b> for most.</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>James Talmage</b>-- &quot;<i>No soul shall be kept in prison or continued
					in torment beyond the time requisite to work the needed reformation and vindicate justice for which ends alone punishment is
					imposed.  After the debt has been paid the prison doors shall be opened, and the spirits once confined in suffering, then
					chastened and clean, shall come forth to partake of the glory provided in their class.</i>&quot; (<i>A Study of the Articles of
					Faith</i>, pp. 146-48.)</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>John Widtsoe</b>-- &quot;<i>How men could devise so horrible a future for
					any one of God’s children is a striking evidence of the apostasy from the simple loving gospel of Jesus Christ. ... The correction
					of this evil doctrine had to be made. ... In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is no hell.  All will find a
					measure of salvation. ... The gospel of Jesus Christ has no hell in the old proverbial sense.</i>&quot;  (<i>Joseph Smith --
					Seeker After Truth</i>, pp. 175, 177-78.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b>  By now it is plain that when a Latter-day Saint talks about
						<i>hell</i> he does not usually mean the same thing a Christian does.  As the quotes above and previous discussion reveal,
						one Mormon idea is that men who believed not the teachings of Joseph Smith go to a spirit prison where they suffer until they
						either accept Mormonism and someone is baptized for them on earth or apparently they simply suffer enough to merit release at
						the judgment or at some point afterward.  The other main idea of hell seems to be that of the <b><i>second death</i></b> or
						<b><i>outer darkness</i></b>.  This <i>is</i> a place of eternal suffering but it is limited to only Satan and his followers
						in the original spirit world who rebelled against Elohim and then the <i>sons of perdition</i>.  In his pamphlet
						<i>Christianity Re-Defined by Mormonism</i>, Mark Champneys concisely defines the Mormon meaning of hell and reveals who
						these <i>sons of perdition</i> are mainly thought to be: &quot;<i>There is no hell per se.  If hell is mentioned it is a
						reference to (1) the Telestial Kingdom; (2) Spirit Prison, a temporary destination before judgment; or (3) Outer Darkness,
						a place reserved for the devil and the demons (and Ex-Mormons).</i>&quot; (Champneys is himself is an ex-Mormon who was
						once very active in the organization.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are, of course, some problems with this denial of eternal punishment
						by the Latter-day Saints.  First, once again, it is inconsistent with their main source of authority, the <i>Book of Mormon</i>.
						It seems Joseph Smith was at first in strong disagreement with those referred to in his day as <b><i>universalists</i></b>
						who taught that a loving, just God would not punish men endlessly. (See <i>Major Problems of Mormonism</i>, pp. 212-13,
						by Tanner and Tanner for more information on this.)  This early position by Joseph Smith is reflected in the <i>Book of
						Mormon</i>, cf. 2 Nephi 28:19-23; Mosiah 2:38-39; Alma 42:16; 3 Nephi 27:11, 17. However, not long after the publication
						of the <i>Book of Mormon</i>, Smith reversed his position and denied in various publications and in the <i>Doctrine and
						Covenants</i> that there will be such a thing as <i>endless</i> or <i>eternal</i> punishment (cf. Section 19:6-7, 10-12).
						More confusion in this convoluted and false system of thought.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another perplexing issue for the Mormon is the final outcome in the one
						place of real eternal punishment they do endorse.  The Tanners in their previously referenced work (pp. 214-216 in a section
						entitled <i>An Ever- Expanding Hell</i>) do a great job exposing this conundrum.  No doubt the intention of the LDS theology
						by restricting the <i>Second Death</i> or <i>Outer Darkness</i> to only Satan, the demons and the sons of perdition is to
						make the idea of such a place more palatable.  If anyone deserves such treatment surely it is these -- and besides, it’s
						not many, right?  Not so fast say the Tanners.  In <i>Doctrines and Covenants</i> 29, Smith reveals that a third of all
						the spirit children followed Satan.  Mormon writer Eugene England estimates that by the end of time eventually 80 billion
						people will have lived on the earth.  Remember that this represents pretty much all the spirit children who did not go after
						Satan.  Those who did follow Lucifer do not get to have earthly lives.  If these made up a third of the total then doing the
						math reveals that Satan was followed by about 40 billion spirit children.  <i>Remember these are the spirit children of
						Elohim!</i>  In his quotation above, while John Widtsoe belittles the biblical teaching of eternal punishment for the wicked
						with his comment about &quot;<i>such a horrible future for any one of God’s children</i>&quot;, his own theology blithely
						condemns 40,000,000,000 of God’s children to that place.  That does not even include the ones who apostasize from the LDS
						church whom most Mormons believe will join Satan in the second death because they had the &quot;truth&quot; and rejected it.
						But it gets worse.  Remember that this process has been repeated and will be repeated an infinite number of times.  Brigham
						Young comments, &quot;<i>How many earths are there?  I observed this morning that you may take the particles of matter composing
						this earth, and if they could be enumerated they would only be a beginning to the number of creations of God; and they are
						continually coming into existence, and undergoing changes and passing through the same experience that we are passing through.
						Sin is upon every earth that ever was created, ... Consequently every earth has its redeemer, and every earth has its tempter;
						and every earth, and the people thereof, in their turn and time, receive all that we receive, and pass through all the ordeals
						that we are passing through.</i>”  (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, vol. 14, pp. 71-72.)  So according to one of their greatest
						leaders and prophets this process is duplicated at an astronomical rate.  It is not unreasonable to expect that each
						&quot;god&quot; should lose about the same number of children each time a tempter arises so what we are faced with is
						ultimately quadrillions of creations with billions from each one lost to the outer darkness of eternal suffering.  If the
						Christian doctrine of hell is &quot;horrible,&quot; as John Widtsoe (quoted above) asserted, is the LDS position any better?
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, the bottom line problem with the Mormon concept of no hell for
						almost everyone who ever lived on earth is that the Bible disagrees with it.  Earlier we refuted the LDS attempt to wrangle
						three kingdoms out of the Bible but we never presented what the Bible teaches about what the potential destinies of man are.
						So let’s return and see what God’s word says about that.  Rhodes and Bodine point out that anytime the Bible speaks about
						judgment and the afterlife it always refers to <b>two classes of people</b> and <b>two possible destinies</b> (<i>Reasoning
						from the Scriptures with the Mormons</i>, pp. 373-75).  Note the following passages:  <b>Daniel 12:2;  Matthew 13:24-30, 37-43;
						Matthew 25:31-46; Luke 16:19-26</b>.  The only two classes are those who are deemed as righteous (because of their faith in
						the Lord)  and those judged to be wicked (because of their unbelief and sin).  The only possible final destinations are the
						kingdom of God (heaven) and the lake of fire (hell).</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note that, contrary to Mr. Widtsoe's comments about the doctrine of hell
						being contrary to the &quot;<i>simple loving gospel of Jesus Christ,</i>&quot; in most of the passages we saw it was Jesus
						Himself doing the teaching.  There are many more.  Jesus often spoke about the coming judgment and warned of the irreversible,
						forever nature of God’s condemnation.  The Bible paints a very vivid picture and insists on the reality of a place of burning,
						fiery torment.  In the last book, Revelation, it is quite clear what the stakes are with regard to our accepting or rejecting
						Jesus Christ (see <b>Revelation 14:10-11; 19:19-20; 20:10, 15; 21:8</b>).</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While, admittedly, <b>hell</b> is not a pleasant subject, it is worse than
						irresponsible to deny that such a place exists and fail to warn those around us about what’s ahead for those who do not commit
						their lives to the Lord.  In fact, the Bible says that those who fail in this will be accountable for the &quot;<i>blood on
						their hands</i>&quot; of those they should have warned (cf. <b>Ezekiel 33:1-9</b>).  While we understand the natural desire
						to not want to dwell on negative things or to hope that bad news will not come to pass, we dare not ignore or deny the
						warnings of Scripture.  We must not sacrifice the truth for the sake of blissful ignorance.  We must not let people perish
						for the sake of avoiding controversial issues.</font></p>

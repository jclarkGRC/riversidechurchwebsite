				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mormons try to claim that they believe in and worship the God of the Bible, the
					same God that true Christians worship.  To this end, their Articles of Faith #1 says &quot;We believe in God, the Eternal Father,
					and His Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.&quot;  Richard L. Evans, a member of the Council of Twelve, said Mormons
					&quot;believe in the Holy Trinity.&quot;  Both of these statements are demonstrably false.  Below is a chart comparing/contrasting
					historical Christian positions concerning God and what Mormons believe:</font></p>

					</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1. Polytheism</b> (<i>Henotheism</i> is a polytheistic system stressing
					one central deity, i.e., &quot;Elohim&quot; is the primary god of this earth so Mormons worship him but acknowledge there are
					other gods in existence for other worlds.)</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Joseph Smith</b>- &quot;<i>I wish to declare I have always and in all
						congregations where I have preached on the subject of deity , it has (been on) the plurality of Gods.</i>&quot; (J.F. Smith,
						<i>Teachings of the Prophet</i>, p. 370.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>- &quot;<i>There are three Gods- the Father, Son and
						Holy Ghost.</i>&quot; <b>And</b>: &quot; <i>... these three are the only Gods we worship.  But, in addition, there is an infinite
						number of holy personages, drawn from worlds without number, who have passed on to exaltation and are thus Gods ...</i>&quot;
						(<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, pp. 317, 576-77.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>Abraham 4:1 </b>- &quot;<i>And then the Lord said: Let us go down.
						And they went down at the beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth</i>.&quot;
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Compare to <b>Isaiah 43:10; 44:6,8; 45:5, 21-22</b> from which Christians
						affirm there is only one true, eternal God.  Mormons are quick to point out the Bible's references to other individuals as
						&quot;<b>gods.</b>&quot;  See <b>II Corinthians 4:4; Exodus 4:16, 7:1; Psalm 82:1,6.</b>  In each case the context gives us
						the meaning of the usage.  In no case is the Bible comparing the one being called a <b>&quot;god&quot;</b> to the eternal,
						almighty God of the universe.  A good verse to respond to this implication is in <b>I Corinthians 8:4-6</b> where Paul says
						the world may have many lords and gods, but there is only one true God.   Polytheism is totally foreign to traditional
						Christian theology.  According to <b>Alma 11:26-29</b> it would seem that polytheism is also foreign to the Book of Mormon.
						(Another contradiction?)</font></p>

				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. An <b>evolving</b> god.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Joseph Smith</b>- &quot;<i>God Himself was once as we are now, and is an
						exalted man and sits enthroned in yonder heavens! ... We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity. I will
						refute that idea ... He was once a man like us. Here, then, is eternal life -- to know the only wise and true God; and you have
						got to learn how to be Gods yourselves.</i>&quot;  (J.F. Smith, <i>Teachings of the Prophet</i>, pp. 345-46 [quoting Joseph
						Smith’s <i>King Follett Discourse</i>].)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Brigham Young</b>-&quot;<i>Remember that God, our Heavenly Father, was
						perhaps once a child, and mortal like we ourselves, and rose step by step in the scale of progress, in the school of
						advancement; has moved forward and overcome until He has arrived at the point where He now is.</i>&quot;  (<i>Journal of
						Discourses</i>, Vol. 1, p. 123.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>Milton Hunter</b>- &quot;<i>Mormon prophets have continually taught
						the sublime truth that God the Eternal Father was once a mortal man who passed through a school of earth life similar to that
						through which we are now passing. He became God -- an exalted being -- through obedience to the same eternal Gospel truths
						that we are given opportunity today to obey.</i>&quot;  (<i>The Gospel Through the Ages</i>, p. 104.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Compare to <b>Numbers 23:19a; Psalm 90:2; Hosea 11:9; Malachi 3:6a;
						James 1:17</b>.  Again the traditional, biblical Christian view is that God has always been God.  He was never a created
						being (a man) and He never changes.  This is in stark contrast with the Mormon opinion.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. A <b>material</b> god.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Joseph Smith</b>-&quot;<i>There is no other God in heaven but that God
						that has flesh and bones.</i>&quot; (Joseph F. Smith, <i>Teachings of the Prophet</i>, p. 181.)  <b>And</b>- &quot; ... if you
						were to see him today, you would see him in all the person, image and very form as a man.</i>”&quot;  (Sermon published
						Aug. 15, 1844.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Parley P. Pratt</b>- &quot;<i>Each of these Gods, including Jesus Christ
						and His Father, being in possession of not merely an organized spirit, but a glorious immortal body of flesh and bones</i> ...
						&quot;(<i>Key to the Science of Theology</i>, p. 44.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>- &quot;<i>God, the Eternal Father, our Father in
						Heaven, is an exalted, perfected, and glorified Personage having a tangible body of flesh and bones.</i>&quot; (<i>Mormon
						Doctrine</i>, p. 278.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">d. <b>Doctrine and Covenants 130:22</b>- &quot;<i>The Father has a body of
						flesh and bones as tangible as man's;</i>&quot;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Compare <b>Luke 24:39; John 4:24</b>.  God the Father is portrayed in the
						Bible as a spirit being.  Nowhere is there any indication that He has a physical body.  When Scriptures speak of the eyes,
						ears, arms, hands, etc.  of the Lord, they are merely literary devices to help humans relate to Him in a way that makes sense.
						They refer to His attributes of seeing, hearing (being aware of all things), His power and strength and so on.  Again, we see
						the Mormon idea of God having a real, flesh and blood, albeit &quot;<b>exalted</b>&quot; (improved) body is not what the Bible
						teaches or what Christianity has historically embraced.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. A <b>sexual</b> god. (This is a natural outgrowth of the Mormon belief that God
					has a physical body.)</font></p>
		        <blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Bruce McConkie</b>- &quot;<i>We are the offspring of God.  He is our
						eternal father; we also have an eternal mother.  There is no such thing as a father without a mother, nor can there be children
						without  parents.  We were born as the spirit children of celestial parents long before the foundations of this world were
						laid.</i>&quot; (<i>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary</i>, Vol. 2, p. 160.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The Mormon teaching is essentially that after attaining exaltation (or
						godhood), a man and his celestial wife (or wives) then sexually beget spirit children.  Closely tied to this is the Mormon
						view that God is a polygamist. </font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. God is a <b>polygamist.</b></font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Brigham Young</b>- &quot;<i>The scripture says He, the Lord, came
						walking in the Temple with His train; I do not know who they were, unless his wives and children.</i>&quot; (<i>Journal of
						Discourses</i>, Vol. 13, p. 308).</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Apostle Orson Pratt</b>- &quot;<i>In the Heaven where our spirits were
						born, there are many Gods, each one of whom has his own wife or wives which were given to him previous to his redemption, while
						yet in mortal state.</i>&quot;  Pratt further commented that God honors polygamy because He is Himself a polygamist. Therefore
						His Son (Jesus) and His people are also polygamists. (<i>The Seer</i>, Vol. 1, No. 11, p. 172.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>FYI:</b> Thus there are two reasons Mormons rationalize and justify
						polygamy (or at least have in the past).  One is that they are only following the example set by God.  The second is that all
						those spirit children in heaven are waiting on a physical body to take their turn at life on earth.  If one wife can produce
						10 children (physical bodies), then 20 wives can produce 200.  Hence, the more wives the better.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- There is absolutely no biblical indication or even a hint that God is
						married, sexually active or that He reproduces Himself in any way.  God is unique and He never changes.  There are only two
						teachings about marriage in heaven.  The first is when Jesus informed the Sadducees that those who are resurrected and go to
						heaven neither marry nor are given in marriage ... period! <b>Cf. Matthew 22:29-30; Mark 12:24-25; Luke 20:34-36</b>.  The
						other concerns the &quot;<i>marriage of the Lamb</i>&quot; (<b>cf. Revelation 19:7, 9</b>) which, though somewhat ambiguous,
						seems to refer to the union of Christ and all those who believe in Him for salvation.  It is metaphorical for a union which
						will never be broken and is characterized by the deepest love possible on the part of both parties. Again, the Bible has
						nothing within it to even suggest that God is sexual and has a wife or many wives.  The idea is ludicrous.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. A <b>morally imperfect</b> god.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a. <b>Milton Hunter</b>- &quot;<i>Mormon prophets have continually taught the
						sublime truth that God the Eternal Father was once a mortal man who passed through a school of earth life similar to that through
						which we are now passing.  He became God -- an exalted being -- through <u>obedience</u> to the same eternal Gospel truths that
						we are given opportunity today to obey.</i>&quot;  (<i>The Gospel Through the Ages</i>, p. 104.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">b. <b>Brigham Young</b>- &quot;<i>&quot;How much unbelief exists in the minds
						of the Latter-day Saints in regard to one particular doctrine which I revealed to them, and which God revealed to me -- namely
						that Adam is our father and God ... 'Well,' says one, 'Why was Adam called Adam?'  He was the first man on earth and its framer
						and maker.  He with the help of his brethren, brought it into existence.  Then he said, 'I want my children who are in the spirit
						world to come and live here.  I once dwelt upon an earth something like this, in a mortal state. I was <b>faithful</b>, I received
						my crown and exaltation.</i>'&quot; (<i>Deseret Weekly News</i>, June 18, 1873, p.308)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">c. <b>Marion G. Romney</b>- &quot;<i>God is a perfected saved soul enjoying
						eternal life.</i>&quot; (<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>, quoted in the Salt Lake Tribune, Oct. 6, 1974.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b> In essence, all the gods of the Mormon religion were imperfect
						men who had to earn exaltation through obedience to Mormon articles of faith.  The obvious questions are: Where did the Mormon
						gospel originate?  Who was the very first god?   Who discovered these truths?</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Compare <b>Leviticus 19:2</b> and <b>Revelation 4:8</b> which tell us that
						God is holy.  We have already looked at Scripture that shows us He is unchanging.  God is eternally holy and has never been in
						need of salvation or justification or of becoming morally perfect.  He has <b>always</b> had those qualities.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In an attempt to bolster their own doctrines, Mormons claim that orthodox
					Christianity is in a state of apostasy and has lost the true knowledge of God.  After having examined LDS beliefs about God, it
					would appear that Mormons have more in common with pagans, who create their own gods with human characteristics, attributes and
					imperfections, than they do with authentic, historic Christianity.  One wonders why they consistently identify themselves as a
					Christian religion when they are in complete disagreement with biblical Christian teachings about God that has been proclaimed
					and accepted since the earliest days of the Church.</font></p>

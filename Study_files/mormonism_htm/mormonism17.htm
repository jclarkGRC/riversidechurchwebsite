			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, some <b>&quot;Do's&quot;</b>:</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. <b>Do pray.</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We should always be praying for opportunities to witness and for God to use us.
					We should also pray for those to whom we have spoken that God might powerfully use the words for His glory.  If you have made
					an appointment with a Mormon missionary to come back for a discussion in order to have a chance to witness to him, it is obviously
					very important to pray for God to prepare his heart to hear the Gospel.  We must always remember that such encounters are part of
					the spiritual warfare that is now raging and only through God’s power will there be victory.  Therefore, prayer is primary.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. <b>Do define your terms clearly.</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the biggest obstacles to effective communication and witnessing to a
					Mormon by a Christian is confusion over what is meant by several key terms.  It can be frustrating and disconcerting to make
					several key statements that reflect the true Gospel only to have the Mormon agree with you completely.  Some have been fooled
					into thinking that Mormons really are Christian in their doctrine.  Make sure that you and he are both understanding what each
					of you means by the phrases and key words you discuss.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>NOTE:</b> For example, &quot;<i>salvation by grace</i>&quot; which to a
						Christian refers to a state of righteousness granted to a person through that person’s faith in the finished work of Jesus
						Christ resulting in an eternal existence in the presence of God in Heaven; but <b>to the Mormon</b> the phrase refers only to a
						<i>general salvation</i> which is merely physical resurrection granted to all unconditionally.  This resurrection is made
						possible by Christ’s sacrifice which paid for Adam’s sin only, <b>not</b> your personal sin.  Thus <i>salvation by grace</i>
						has nothing to do with your destiny in eternity.  You must earn your <i>individual salvation</i> or <i>exaltation</i> by
						paying for your own sins through good works and complete obedience to the Mormon gospel.  Only in that way can you be judged
						worthy of the third level of the celestial heaven where Heavenly Father dwells.</em></font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. <b>Do ask probing questions.</b> </font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is important for at least three reasons. First, it communicates that you
					have an interest in and a respect for his thoughts and ideas.  For most people, it is flattering to be given serious queries.
					Second, it allows you to draw out what he believes without obnoxiously, presumptuously declaring or implying that you already
					know everything about his doctrine and his personal beliefs.  Third, and perhaps most importantly, leading questions can
					trigger serious thinking.  It is quite easy to disregard another person’s assertions about an issue but it is very difficult
					to ignore answers that I see for myself when engaging a challenging question.  One of our goals is to help the Mormon come to
					the correct conclusions on his own based on what he can see in the Bible as a result of such questions.  We should seek to draw
					the answers from him by forcing him to consider the matter. This should be done in a calm, non-threatening, unemotional manner.
					Use your questions to quietly, persistently undermine the authority of the Mormon church and its teachings.</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Note:</b> One good area to pursue in this way might be the complete lack
						of external, historical, archaeological evidence for anything that was recorded in the Book of Mormon.  Sometimes the Mormon
						may defensively testify to you that &quot;<i>Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, the Mormon church is true, Jesus is the Christ,
						the president of the Mormon church is a prophet on the earth today, and I say this in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</i>&quot;
						Ron Rhodes says to reply with, &quot;<i>I testify that Joseph Smith was a false prophet, the Mormon church is not true, Jesus
						Christ is my personal Lord and Savior, the president of the Mormon church is not a prophet on the earth today, and I say this
						in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</i>&quot; (<i>Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Mormons</i>, pp. 34-35).  The point
						to be made is that his testimony is no better than yours.  After this exchange (or by other avenues) ask the Mormon what
						he bases his beliefs on.  Most of the time he will talk about the &quot;<i>burning in his bosom</i>.&quot;  Ask him if he
						thinks God would expect people to completely base their lives and futures solely on emotional feelings (after all, hasn’t
						God revealed Himself to us in many ways?). Ask if people ever make drastic mistakes by letting their emotions rule their
						decisions (suicides, assaults, murders, bad investments?).  Ask him if it is a legitimate expectation to see evidence in the
						real world of what God through his prophets has declared in the Scriptures to be true.  If he says &quot;yes&quot; then ask
						him to show you some evidence that the Book of Mormon accounts are true, like maps of where all the activity took place, etc.
						(If he refers to Central and South American native ruins you need to be ready to refute that.)</em></font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. <b>Do take your time.</b></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the opposite of &quot;Don’t&quot; number two but is worth emphasizing.
					It is better to thoroughly discuss one or two topics and give him something to chew on than rush through many and cause confusion.
					If it is the Mormon who is doing the rushing, slow him down.  As a corollary, when reading the Scriptures about an issue, read
					them out loud and have the Mormon focus on what is actually being said.  He will often have a pat response for many key Bible
					passages -- make sure he has the opportunity to consider and comprehend what God’s word is really saying.</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, one approach to witnessing to Mormons which is endorsed by ex-Mormon Mark
				Champneys as being direct, effective and inoffensive involves inquiring about the ultimate goal of following Mormonism.  If you ask the
				thoughtful, serious Mormon this question he will generally reply or agree that the big picture is &quot;to dwell with Heavenly
				Father.&quot; (Don’t use this occasion to attack the idea that achieving this will also allow one to continue on to his godhood and
				kingdom -- focus on just the idea of getting to be with God the Father in the celestial heaven).  But the only problem with this is that
				no Mormon can have complete assurance that he has done enough.  Even after doing all he can do, the final decision will be in the hands of
				Elohim, Jehovah (Jesus) and Joseph Smith.  They can decide that he is not worthy.  The upshot is that no Mormon knows for sure that his
				efforts will be enough.  This ultimate insecurity should be troubling to the serious Mormon.  Ask the Mormon if he knows for sure he will
				be in the third level of the celestial heaven.  Ask him if he has obeyed completely.  Ask him if he has committed the same sin again after
				requesting forgiveness.  Ask him if he has truly stopped sinning altogether.  If he is honest he will affirm that he has failed in these
				things and has no real assurance.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Against this backdrop, the Christian can present the true plan of God’s salvation.  He
				can ask a telling question -- &quot;<i>Why should I trade my full salvation by grace through faith in Jesus with absolute assurance
				based on God’s Word for a plan in which I must toil endlessly to do good works to offset my sin which I cannot stop committing and
				which no matter how hard I try I may not measure up?</i>&quot;  He may reply that you should trade because he believes his plan is
				the true one.  You should insist, of course, that the evidence does not back that statement up.  But no matter what his answer is,
				you will have given him something to think about. Pray that God will use that doubt and uneasiness to bring him to true understanding.
				For more on this read Mark Champney’s works listed above.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conclusion of this section let me encourage us all:  Don’t be afraid.  Be bold.
				We are not required to be perfect even in our witnessing -- we are only called to be faithful.  While we may never master all the
				techniques and perhaps never memorize all the Bible verses, we can be sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit who can use even
				poor vessels like us to accomplish His will in another person’s life.  My prayer is that this study has helped us a little along
				the way.</font></p>

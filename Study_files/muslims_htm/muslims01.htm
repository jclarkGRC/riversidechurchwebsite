/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/

	width: 46em;  /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 800px browser window if text is left at browser default font sizes */
	background: #FFFFFF;
	margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margins (in conjunction with a width) center the page */
	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */
}  

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;
}
.clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */
	clear:both;
    height:0;
    font-size: 1px;
    line-height: 0px;

    <h1>A Brief Look at a Non-Christian Religion:  ISLAM</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Islam is not a cult (i.e., a perversion of Christianity) as such but rather is a major world religion fundamentally different from Christianity.  Although its base is 
    	thought of as primarily in the Middle East and northern Africa, Islam reaches all around the globe and rivals Christianity for the distinction of having the greatest 
    	number of followers.  The growth of Islam over the last two decades has been phenomenal.  In 1990, estimates of the number of those claiming to be Muslim ranged 
    	between 400 and 700 million.  Today, it is widely thought that there are 1.2 billion plus adherents to Islam.  This expansion has been worldwide.  Due in large part to 
    	enormous waves of immigration from the Middle East region, Islam has been the fastest growing religion in Western Europe and North America for the past ten to fifteen 
    	years.</p>
	<p>We are going to examine the basic history of Islam, consider the main tenets of the faith, take a look at the major differences between Islam and Christianity, and 
		finally, share a few pointers concerning how to share the gospel with a Muslim acquaintance or friend.  In composing this study I drew from several sources including: 
		<i>Two Old Faiths</i> (Chautauqua Press, 1891) by J. Murray Mitchell and Sir William Muir; <i>The Sacred Writings of the World's Great Religions</i> (The Blakiston 
		Company, 1943) by S.E. Frost, Jr.; <i>Handbook of Today's Religions</i> (Here's Life Publishers, Inc., 1983) by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart;  <i>What's the Big Deal 
		About Other Religions</i>? (Harvest House Publishers, 2008) by John Ankerberg and Dillon Burroughs; <i>30 Days Muslim Prayer Focus</i> booklet published by the "10/40 
		Window Project", 1999 & 2000 editions;  <i>Breakpoint with Charles Colson</i> articles dated 10/15/2001 thru 10/19/2001; and several other small miscellaneous articles.  
		Because most of the sources had similar information I did not footnote individual items--there was general consensus on most counts.  In no way do I claim to be expert 
		in this subject and welcome comment, criticism and correction from those who may have more firsthand knowledge than I.</p>

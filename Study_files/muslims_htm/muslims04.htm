body  {
	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

	margin: 0; /* it's good practice to zero the margin and padding of the body element to account for differing browser defaults */

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/

	width: 46em;  /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 800px browser window if text is left at browser default font sizes */
	background: #FFFFFF;
	margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margins (in conjunction with a width) center the page */
	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */
}  

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;
}
.clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */
	clear:both;

    <h1>A Brief Look at a Non-Christian Religion:  ISLAM</h1>
    <h2><em>Beliefs and Practices</em></h2>
	<ol type="I">
		<li>
			<b>The Five Articles of Faith</b>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					<i>God:</i>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							There is only one true god and his name is Allah.  God is absolutely unapproachable by man.  This is because he is so far above his creation. He has 
							revealed his preeminent will by communicating through a progression of angels and prophets.  Muhammed is seen as the final and greatest prophet.
						</li>
						<li>
							Allah is seen as a god of judgment and wrath.  Though the Qu'ran often refers to Allah's grace and mercy to Muslims (e.g., Surah VI:165) there is 
							little emphasis on such attributes.  Allah is perfect and has given the guidance men need through Muhammed to live a life pleasing to him.  A key 
							factor here is that Muslims believe that man is born innately good and sinless with the capability to be obedient to Allah.  Judgment will consist 
							of essentially weighing good deeds against bad deeds so entry into heaven is a matter of personal effort (hence the idea of <i>submission</i>.)
						</li>
						<li>
							The Qu’ran states that both “<i>good and evil come from Allah</i>.”  This illustrates the capricious nature of Allah.  Whatever he chooses is right 
							because it is his will.  Thus a Muslim can never be assured of selection to paradise even if all matters of the faith are obeyed because Allah can 
							choose to do otherwise no matter what else he has said.  The only certain way to paradise is to die as a martyr in a holy war (<i>jihad</i>).
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Angels:</i>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							Angels exist to serve Allah with each one having a different function. Gabriel is the leading angel in Muslim thought.  According to Islam, angels are 
							made of light.  Each person has two attending angels--one to record your good deeds and the other to record  your evil deeds.
						</li>
						<li>
							The devil (<i>Al Shaytan</i>) is either a fallen angel or a djinn.  Djinn are creatures somewhere between angels and man and can be either good or evil.  
							Though it may be the idea of djinn originated from the influence of pagan religions in Africa, it plays a prominent role in the lives of most Muslims.  
							Westerners might use the term <i>genie</i>, the legendary powerful being who lives in a lamp and may grant a wish but vindictively might also seek to 
							use your words against you for ill.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Scriptures</i>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							There are four divinely inspired books according to Islamic teaching. They are:
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									The sayings of Moses and the prophets (called the <i>Torah</i>).
								</li>
								<li>
									The psalms of David (<i>Zabin</i>).
								</li>
								<li>
									The sayings of Jesus (<i>Injil</i>).
								</li>
								<li>
									The <i>Qu'ran</i> (which is supplemented by the <i>Hadith</i> with regard to socio-political life).
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							However, Christians need to understand that what the Muslims have of the writings of Moses, David, and the Gospels are <i>not</i> the same as what 
							we have in the Bible.  Further, Muslims claim that the first three sources have been lost or corrupted by Jews and Christians.  Only the Qu'ran has 
							been preserved free from error.  For that reason and because Muslims also believe it is the final and superior revelation, the Qu’ran  supersedes 
							the other inspired books.  Thus, it alone has any real authority.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Prophets:</i>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							Islamic theology teaches that Allah has sent many (some say over 100,000 in all) prophets down through the centuries and that there was a great 
							prophet for every age in mankind’s history.
						<li>
							The six greatest of these are:  Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammed, who is, of course, the last and greatest of them all.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>The Last Day:</i>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							This will be a time of resurrection and judgment.  Following the fulfillment of 25 signs (though the exact day and hour is hidden), all men will be 
							raised and judged according to what their angels have recorded in the books.  Allah will weigh each man’s deeds in the balances.
						</li>
						<li>
							Some will be admitted to the Muslim concept of Heaven which is called Paradise.  Here they will recline on soft couches eating and drinking cups of 
							wine served by the maidens of Paradise called <i>Huris</i>.  Each man may marry as many of the Huris as he pleases.
						</li>
						<li>
							The majority, however, will be consigned to the torments of Hell.  All those who were enemies of Islam will go there, of course.  However it is 
							expected that even most believers of Islam will have to enter the fire for at least a while to be purified, though no true Muslim will have to 
							stay forever.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					**  There is a sixth important teaching which some believe should be added to the Five Articles because of the central role it plays in Muslim life.  It is 
					the doctrine of God’s immutable decrees or, in other words, the idea of fate.  The term used is <b>kismet</b>.  Muslims have a strict view of predestination.  
					All results come from the wishes of Allah.  This is reflected in the common Islamic phrase, “<i>It is the will of Allah</i>,” which is used to underscore the 
					uselessness of trying to exert one’s own will on life's situations.  Some have partially attributed the relative lack of  significant progress in science, 
					technology, healthcare, etc. in the Middle East compared to other parts of the world to this fatalistic attitude.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>The Five Pillars of Faith</b><br />
			The Five Articles of Faith are what Muslims <b>believe</b>.  The Five Pillars are what Muslims must <b>do</b>.  The only chance to escape the judgment of Allah lies 
			in the unwavering, diligent performance of these works:
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					<i>The Creed  (kalima or shahadah)</i><br />
					The statement “<i>There is no God but Allah and Muhammed is the prophet of Allah</i>” forms the foundation of Muslim belief.  In order to become a 
					Muslim, one must say this aloud and publicly.  It is repeated often by faithful followers of Islam.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Prayer  (salat)</i><br />
					Muslims are required to pray five times a day--upon rising, at noon, at midafternoon, at sunset and upon retiring.  The prayers involve recitations 
					from the Qu'ran and other prescribed actions (facing Mecca, bowing, kneeling, prostrate on ground, standing, etc.) detailed in the <i>Hadith</i>.  
					It is a mechanical, ritualistic process rather than communion with God.  There is usually a public call to prayer.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Almsgiving  (zakat)</i><br />
					Muslims are required to give at least one fortieth of their monetary income to the poor.  There are other additional requirements or arrangements for 
					wealth in the form of cattle, produce, etc.  One can also, of course, give beyond this with free will offerings.  Those receiving alms need feel no 
					sense of indebtedness to the giver because it is his duty and they, through their need, are helping him get to Paradise.  Indeed, according to Islam, 
					it is the giver who should feel fortunate he has someone whom he can help.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Fasting  (saum)</i><br />
					During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims are required to fast and refrain from all other bodily pleasures from sunrise to sunset.  The idea is to 
					develop self-control, devotion (obedience) to God and sympathy for the hungry and destitute.  Most Muslims eat two meals a day during Ramadan -- an 
					early breakfast before sunrise and dinner after sunset.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>The Pilgrimage  (hajj)</i><br \>
					At least once during his lifetime, the faithful Muslim should make the trip to the city of Mecca where Muhammed was born and the center of the Islamic 
					faith.  Involved in this journey are several rituals and ceremonies mostly revolving around the mosque in Mecca and the holy Black Stone (<i>Ka'aba</i>) 
					displayed there.  Older or infirm Muslims who cannot make the journey are allowed to send someone else in their place.
				</li>
				<li>
					**  There is a sixth religious duty which was once seen as a Pillar in the early days of Islam.  It is the requirement of <i>Holy War (jihad</i>).  
					It was once thought by most Muslims that it was their duty to kill anyone who refused to accept Islam.  This was seen as a legitimate way of expanding 
					Islamic borders and influence.  Most Muslims have toned it down since then.  Shi'ites have discussed restoring this standard.  Whether it is official 
					or not, several Islam dominated countries under Shari'a (Islamic law) routinely persecute, sell into slavery, or even kill Christians and other 
					non-Muslims.  The governments of such nations either, at worst, condone such activity, or at best, do little or nothing about it.   However, it should 
					also be noted that, in Muslim thought, <i>jihad</i> can also refer to the personal struggle to do what is good and right.  Some believe that this inner 
					war against temptation, selfishness and evil, which every person faces, is indeed the greater <i>jihad</i>.

	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/

	background: #FFFFFF;

	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */
}  

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;

.clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */

    <h1>A Brief Look at a Non-Christian Religion:  ISLAM</h1>
	<h2><strong><em>A Brief History</em> </strong></h2>
	<ol type="I">
		<li>
			<b>Muhammed</b>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					<i>Early Life:</i>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							He was born around A.D. 570 in the city of Mecca located in Arabia.
						</li>
						<li>
							His parents and a grandfather died by the time he was six years old.  He was raised by an uncle and later worked as trader on the caravan routes.
						</li>
						<li>
							In early life it is said he may have suffered from fits (perhaps epilepsy). In early adulthood, he was unusually religious and tried to live morally. 
							In business, he became known as the “<i>trustworthy one</i>.”  At age 25, he married a wealthy, 40-year-old widow named Khadijah for whom he had 
							previously managed caravan trade.
						</li>
						<li>
							He eventually became thoroughly dissatisfied with the polytheism which was rampant in Arabia.  Perhaps through the influence of Jewish and Christian 
							acquaintances, he became convinced that there was only one true god as opposed to the hundreds of gods and goddesses commonly worshipped by the general 
							populace.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>His Call:</i>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							At age 40, he had his first vision.  He was given to retiring to a cave in the mountains during the month of Ramadan to fast and pray.  He began 
							receiving and recording revelations and instructions from a being he finally came to believe was the archangel Gabriel sent from Allah. These 
							writings eventually became the Qu’ran.
						</li>
						<li>
							His wife and a wealthy merchant became the first converts to his new teachings.  Slowly the new movement began to grow, however, he eventually 
							encountered opposition in his hometown, Mecca.  He and his followers moved to what became known as Medina, meaning “<i>City of the Prophet</i>.”  
							This event, known as The Hijira (or “<i>Flight</i>”), on July 16, 622 is recognized by Muslims as the beginning point of Islam.
						</li>
						<li>
							A few years later he and his followers returned to Mecca, conquered it and declared it the center of Islam.  From that time until his death, 
							Muhammed took a zealous and militant approach to spreading Islam.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>After Muhammed</b>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					<i>His Death</i>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							Muhammed died unexpectedly of a fever in A.D. 632.  Because of the suddenness of his death, he left no will nor clear instructions regarding successors 
							to his leadership.
						</li>
						<li>
							Due to this there came to be a division of leadership and the formation of various groups within the religion.  Immediately after Muhammed’s death, 
							the followers chose Abu Bakr (one of Muhammed’s earliest converts and closest friends) as his successor (the first Caliph or Khalifa).  He was 
							recognized as both the religious and political leader of Islam.  Being very old he died less than two years after being chosen. The man who had 
							strongly sponsored him, 'Umar ibn al Khattab, then was himself chosen (Islam’s borders were expanded greatly under his guidance).  Also recognized 
							as a Caliph was 'Ali, a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammed, being married to Fatima, Muhammed’s daughter. 'Ali and his sons were eventually murdered 
							by a man named Mu’awiya who then claimed the position of Caliph for himself.
						</li>
						<li>
							The way these first Caliphs were chosen became a sticking point and a major factor in the development of the two major factions of Islam.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Sects of Islam:</i>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							<i>Sects of Islam:</i>
						</li>
						<li>
							The Sunnis
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									Accepted that any “Early Believer” from Muhammed’s tribe could legitimately be chosen as a Caliph or successor to Muhammed to enforce Islamic 
									law and lead in the militant expansion.  They have no problem recognizing the legitimacy of all four early Caliphs.
								</li>
								<li>
									Another area of conflict that arose besides leadership concerned the development of Islamic law and theology. Eventually there arose four 
									recognized, orthodox schools of thought which, though distinctive, agreed on key issues.  They all recognized and accepted: 1)That the Qur’an 
									was authoritative; 2) The <i>Sunna</i> (i.e., the expressed practices and beliefs of Muhammed in the Hadith and as noted elsewhere) also had 
									authority; and 3) the four bases of Islamic law (or <i>Shari'a</i>), which are the <b>Qur’an</b>, the <b>Hadith</b>, the <b>Ij’ma’</b> (i.e., 
									the consensus of the Muslim community), and the <b>Q’yas</b> (use of reason.)
								</li>
								<li>
									All those who belong to one of these four schools of thought with regard to Islamic law and theology are called Sunnis.  Because there is some 
									level of acceptance, mutual recognition and compromise the Sunnis are often seen as the more moderate of the two major factions. However, we 
									must recognize that this so-called tolerance is applied more liberally to fellow Sunni Muslims than to outside infidels (e.g., Osama bin Laden 
									is a Sunni) or even to the second faction in Islam. Approximately 85-90 percent of Muslims are of Sunni persuasion.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							The Shi'a (Shi'ites)
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									After the death of Muhammed, some followers felt that he left a clear successor in his cousin, 'Ali, who was married to Muhammed's daughter, 
									Fatima.  Though Sunnis also recognize 'Ali as a legitimate Caliph, the Shi'ites do not recognize other successors.  They broke away and 
									became a separate community of Muslims.
								</li>
								<li>
									Typically they are seen as more radical than the Sunnis.  They believe it possible for current religious scholars and leaders of the sect 
									to receive divine revelation and add to the Qu'ran.  Generally they are more literal and fanatical in the social aspects of Islam.
								</li>
								<li>
									Though obviously a much smaller (less than ten percent overall) segment of  Islamic society than the Sunnis, the Shi'ites are still the 
									second largest division.  They are located chiefly in the country of Iran where they dominate with an approximate 93 percent majority.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							Other groups
							<ol type="a">
								<li>
									The Sufis are characterized by what conservative Muslims might call a mystical attitude in that they seek a more personal relationship with 
									Allah.  This is likely in response to the natural human need for God. They are generally rejected by more mainstream adherents of Islam.
								</li>
								<li>
									The Ahmdiyans seek to be the scholarly apologists of the Islamic faith.  They produce most of the Islamic literature and are visible on 
									American college campuses debating and proselytizing students.
								</li>
								<li>
									Some other names of minor Islamic groups are the Ismaelis, Alawi, Shafi’ites and Hanafi’rites.
								</li>

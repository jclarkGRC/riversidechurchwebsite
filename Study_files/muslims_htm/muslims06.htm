body  {
	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	background: #666666;
	margin: 0; /* it's good practice to zero the margin and padding of the body element to account for differing browser defaults */

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/
.twoColElsRt #container { 
	width: 46em;  /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 800px browser window if text is left at browser default font sizes */
	background: #FFFFFF;
	margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margins (in conjunction with a width) center the page */
	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */
}  

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;
}
.clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */
	clear:both;

    font-size: 1px;

    <h1>A Brief Look at a Non-Christian Religion:  ISLAM</h1>
    <h2><em>Approaching a Muslim Friend</em></h2>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>
			Most importantly, <b>pray</b> for him. Some specific issues to pray about are:
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					For your friend to receive a full revelation of God’s character.
				</li>
				<li>
					Against the fears and superstitions that may influence him.
				</li>
				<li>
					That he will come to understand that God desires to know him as a child, not just a servant or a slave.
				</li>
				<li>
					For him to experience true conviction of sin as something which breaks God’s heart and thus come to desire forgiveness.
				</li>
				<li>
					That the Holy Spirit will work powerfully in his heart.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			Be to him a true, loving <b>friend</b>.  Because of the oppressive nature of the laws he may have left behind in his native land, he isn’t used to being loved.  
			Ashton Stewart, director of <b>Persian Ministries for World Witness</b> says, “<i>What many Christians don’t realize is that just being a normal Christian is a 
			radical witness to most Muslims</i>.”  Inviting him over for a meal or merely expressing interest in him will be eye opening.
		</li>
		<li>
			As the friendship deepens you then need to expose him to the <b>realities of our faith</b>.  Examples might include: praying in his presence, inviting him to a 
			Bible study, giving him a New Testament in his own language.  This will also mean being prepared to explain basic Christian beliefs.  Emphasize the love of God and 
			the assurance of salvation through faith in Christ.
		</li>
		<li>
			Understand what it may <b>cost</b> your Muslim friend to make a decision for Christ. Not that you shouldn’t encourage him to do so, but know that you may need to 
			be prepared to help as he struggles with potential loss of family, friends, job and culture.  These losses will typically be the result of being rejected and 
			ostracized by those close to him who are still practicing Islam.
		</li>
		<li>
			Regarding the current issue of Islamic terrorism, understand that your Muslim friend will probably have a perspective that Christians are just as guilty of hatred and 
			bloodshed as Muslims.  It will not be productive to downplay the error and atrocities of the medieval Crusades or deny that the people of the Middle East have suffered 
			over the centuries at the hands of more technologically advanced nations.  If possible, it would probably be better to avoid this topic altogether.  However, if it must 
			be addressed, stress that though sometimes Christians (because they are imperfect humans) make terrible mistakes and are the cause of other people suffering and may 
			even do it in the name of Jesus Christ, yet nowhere are Christians commanded in the New Testament to exercise power or use force to spread the Gospel.  That coercive 
			sort of attitude is foreign to the New Testament.  Therefore those who attempt to do so are acting without the sanction of the Lord and, I believe, will answer for it 
			someday.  On the other hand, if your Muslim friend is knowledgeable and honest, he cannot say the same thing about the attitude of the Qu'ran regarding the use of force 
			and power to coerce people into Islam (<i>jihad</i>).  That may perhaps give him something to think about if he is a sincere, peace loving individual.

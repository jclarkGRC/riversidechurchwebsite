	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.

	background: #FFFFFF;

	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */
}  

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;

.clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */

    <h1>Differences Between Islam and Christianity</h1>
    <h2><em>Differences Between Islam and Christianity</em></h2>
	<p>Because of several factors (e.g., a strong belief in one god, the acceptance of Jesus as a prophet, and a strong presence in and around the Holy Land), some take Islam to 
		be merely a variation of Judaism and/or Christianity.  They assume that these religions are similar and share the same basic principles.  In essence, the idea is that 
		Islam is just another way of worshipping the same God Christians worship.  As we have already seen and will now review in a brief synopsis, nothing could be further 
		from the truth.</p>
	<ol type="I">
		<li>
			<b>Beliefs about God</b>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					Muslims reject the doctrine of the Trinity, which is a keystone of the Christian faith.  They accuse Christians of worshipping three gods.
				</li>
				<li>
					Their god, Allah, is unapproachable.  He is so transcendent that he must use angels to communicate with mankind.  Christians believe God greatly desires us to 
					approach Him in prayer and worship through the mediation of Jesus Christ the Son.  Indeed God Himself dwells within believers in Christ in the Person of the 
					Holy Spirit.
				</li>
				<li>
					Allah is seen primarily as vindictive and vengeful rather than loving and merciful.  While Christians know the Lord will ultimately judge all men, we believe 
					that He takes no joy in doing so but would rather see men be reconciled to Himself through the atonement of Jesus Christ.
				</li>
				<li>
					Muslims see Allah as the source of both good and evil--meaning by this that he takes an active role in the creation and perpetuation of evil.  Allah can do 
					whatever he wishes, even if it contradicts his own rules and standards.  By definition, whatever he does is right.  Thus, Christians would say Allah is 
					capricious.  Christians know that God is the author of good only and is never the source of evil.  He allows parts of His creation the opportunity of free 
					will and some of them have chosen to work evil and reject His will.  The Lord is always consistent, never changing, never lying and never contradicting Himself.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Beliefs about Jesus.</b>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					Muslims believe Jesus was only a prophet, probably the second greatest after Muhammed.  They reject the Christian belief that he was (is) God the Son 
					(second Person of the Holy Trinity).  They do believe, however, that He was sinless (though this is not as significant as one might think--see below).  
					In Islamic thought, equating Jesus (or anyone) with Allah is blasphemy.
				</li>
				<li>
					Muslims do not believe that Jesus was actually crucified.  The two main schools of thought are:
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							Judas was somehow substituted for Jesus beforehand without anyone knowing and died in His place.
						</li>
						<li>
							Jesus was indeed hung on the cross but God rescued Him and took Him bodily to heaven without dying.
						</li>
					</ol>
					Christians believe, of course, that Jesus was crucified, literally died, was buried and rose on the third day according to the Scriptures and the testimony 
					of many witnesses.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Beliefs about the Bible</b>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					Muslims believe that parts of the Bible are inspired but most or all has been corrupted by Christians and Jews.
				</li>
				<li>
					They believe that the Qu'ran is the latest and final revelation from Allah and therefore it supersedes the Bible.  They reject the Christian belief that 
					the Bible is the only source of authority for the knowledge of God and for faith and practice in relating to the worship of Him.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Beliefs about Sin and Salvation.</b>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					Muslims believe that sin is only a lack of obedience to the will of Allah. They believe people are born with the capability to obey Allah which is contrary 
					to the Christian doctrine of depravity (i.e., that all human beings are born with a sinful nature because of the fall of Adam and Eve).  Thus to Muslims 
					people are sinful only by action (what they do or fail to do) rather than by nature (what they are).
				</li>
				<li>
					Salvation for most Muslims is only possible (though not assured due to capriciousness of Allah) through an unwavering adherence to the <i>Articles of 
					Faith</i> and the diligent performance of the Pillars of Faith.  It is a legalistic, mechanical system.  They reject the Christian doctrine of grace 
					alone by faith alone in Christ alone as the only means of being reconciled to God for ultimate salvation.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p><b>**  In these key areas Islam belief is foreign to Christian doctrine.  Muslims reject the Trinity, the deity, crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, the innate 
		depravity of man, salvation by grace through faith in Christ and the Bible as God’s completed revelation of truth.  When people say that Islam and Christianity really 
		worship the same God and are similar in their beliefs they speak either in ignorance or to deceive.  It is a <u>different</u> religion altogether. </b></p>

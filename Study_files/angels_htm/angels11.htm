	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/

	background: #FFFFFF;

	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */
}  

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;
}
.clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */

    <h1> A Brief Study of Angels</h1>
    <h2><em>What are demons like?</em></h2>
    <p><img src="images/200px-AngelCaido.jpg" alt="Demon" width="200" height="300" hspace="10" align="left" />Since we have concluded that demons are actually angels which have 
    		fallen from their holy state by rebelling against God, it stands to reason that angels and demons share many of the same attributes.  This seems to be borne out in the 
    		Bible. The following is an examination of the passages which give us insight into the nature and characteristics of these beings.</p>
    <p>First, as with the holy angels, demons are <i>personal</i> or perhaps a better way of putting it is that they are individual creatures each with its own personality.  They 
    		are not just cosmic forces or some sort of raw power such as an electromagnetic field or gravity or wind.  We can see this plainly in the scriptures.  For one thing, 
    		we can see that they have <b>intelligence</b>.  This is revealed by the fact that Jesus and others conversed with them on different occasions (Matt. 8:28-32; Mark 9:25-26; 
    		Acts 19:13-15).  Also we are told that demons have a belief system and doctrine that they hold to and propagate (I Tim. 4:1-3).  As with the angels, their knowledge is 
    		no doubt greater than man’s for they have access to information that we do not. For instance, the demons possessing the man in Mark 1:23-24 knew exactly who Jesus 
    		really was while the other people in the synagogue at that point had no clue. However we must reiterate that although demons may know more than we do, they are not 
    		omniscient--they do not know everything.  This is because they are created by God and therefore limited.  Only God Himself has all knowledge.</p>
	<p>The Bible also discloses that demons have <b>emotions</b>.  Some of the passages we have seen show that they had a great fear of what Jesus was capable of doing to them 
			and James 2:19 clearly affirms this fact.  Although we have no clear Bible statement to confirm this, it seems that just as angels take great joy in the salvation of 
			humans (Luke 15:7,10) demons likely take great and perverse joy in the destruction of humans.  This can be deduced by the fact that in almost every instance of demon 
			possession we see in the Bible the person possessed is being hurt and systematically taken to his ruin.  Their usual response to Jesus casting them out of humans 
			(<i>“cried out”</i>) as well as the actions seen in Acts 19:16 probably reflects anger and hatred.</p>
	<p>Demons also have the ability of self-determination, or in other words, a <b>will</b>.  If we are right about their fall being the result of following Satan in rebellion 
			against God, then obviously that was a choice that they made.  Jude 6 also indicates that they possess this trait.</p>
	<p>Finally, they have a sense of self or a personal <b>identity</b>.  We have already seen examples of how they use personal pronouns (<i>“I, we, us”</i>) to refer to 
			themselves.  They also have (or take) names according to Mark 5:6-9.  These four things (intelligence, emotions, volition and sense of self) are the hallmarks of 
			personality.</p>
	<p>The other major characteristic of demons is that, again like the holy angels, they are <i>spirits</i>.  That this is true according to the Bible is undeniable (Matt. 8:16; 
			Luke 10:17, 20; also compare Matt. 17:18 with Mark 9:25.)  What does it mean to be a spirit?  Since we have already discussed this in the Holy Angels section we will 
			not dwell on it except to quote Merrill Unger who says, <i>“The specific attribute of ‘spirit’ is incorporeity or immateriality.  ‘A spirit has not flesh and bones’ 
			(Luke 24:39); that is, demons do not possess a material body.”</i>  (<i>Demons in the World Today</i>, p. 22.)</p>
	<p>As we saw with the angels, however, this does not mean that demons are weak and ineffective.  On the contrary they have great power.  This is implied in the tremendous 
			strength they imbue to the people they possess (Mark 5:2-4; Acts 19:16).  In Revelation we see that demons will be unrestrained for a time and will wreak much 1
			destruction by the fact that they will control certain terrible beings (9:10-11; 14-16).  Jesus Himself implied that demons are inherently powerful in Matthew 
			12:28-29 and Mark 9:28-29.  But again we must understand that as powerful as they may be in relation to us, they are no match for the Lord and they know it.  As we 
			have seen in many of our passages, any authority they have or activity they pursue is limited to what the God allows (cf.  Rev. 9:4-5; 14-15).  They are neither 
			omnipresent (everywhere at once) nor omnipotent (all powerful).  Only God Himself has those characteristics.</p>
	<p>The final attribute, which almost goes without mentioning, is that demons are absolutely and irrevocably opposed to God.  They have become utterly evil.  In this they 
			are the opposite of the holy angels.  They have given their allegiance to Satan and even though they seem to know it is a losing proposition there is no going back.  
			They have an undying hatred for God and the things of God.  Their only solace is perhaps that they can hurt God by bringing about the destruction of the most beloved 
			part of His creation--men and women, boys and girls.  This may explain their elaborate, energetic and endless efforts toward this goal.  We will see more of this later 
			as we consider what demons do in relation to mankind.</p>

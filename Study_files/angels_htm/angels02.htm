	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	background: #666666;

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/

	background: #FFFFFF;

	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */
}  

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;
}
.clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */
	clear:both;

    <h1> A Brief Study of Angels</h1>
    <h2>Holy Angels </h2>
    <p><img src="images/angel_warrior.jpg" alt="Angel" width="246" height="277" hspace="10" align="left" />Taking each of the three subjects separately (holy angels, fallen 
    		angels and Satan), we will ask several questions which should address most of the issues regarding angelic beings.  In areas where there is some redundancy between 
    		the three, we will endeavor to be brief.</p>
	<p><strong><em>Do angels really exist?</em></strong></p>
	<p>We ask this question primarily to point out the fact there is no source of reliable information about these beings other than the Bible.  The main reason for so much 
			skepticism about angels and the supernatural during what is known as the <b><i>modern era</b></i> (believing mainly that which can be proven by the scientific method) 
			is that there is no absolute proof for the existence of angels.  There have always been (and are) a few people who claim to have seen or spoken with angels but it 
			has never been common, thus it has not been convincing enough for most in the past.</p>
	<p>We have already commented, however, that belief in angels is now widespread.  Why is that?  There has been a change in the underlying philosophy and worldview of society.  
			We have moved into the <b><i>postmodern</b></i> era.  This has happened because the promises of the modern era were not kept.  In other words man did not find complete 
			satisfaction and fulfillment in the materialism and naturalism of that philosophy.  Science and technology did not make things better--in fact things got worse in 
			general.  So people began looking into the supernatural and spiritual realm for answers and satisfaction.  The interest in angels is part of that.</p>
	<p>Many have written and speculated about angels in ancient times (chiefly a Syrian mystic who called himself Dionysius), the Middle Ages (Thomas Aquinas), the Reformation 
			years (John Calvin and John Milton--whose work <i>Paradise Lost</i> is probably most responsible for present day popular ideas about angels, demons and hell), and 
			the modern period (Karl Barth and many New Age writers).  But predating and outstripping them all with regard to accuracy and reliability is, of course, the Bible.</p>
	<p>As with God Himself, the Bible never sets out to make a case for the reality of angels--it merely assumes that they exist and records some of their activities and other 
			information concerning them.  They are mentioned in 34 of the 66 books of the Bible (17 in the Old Testament and 17 in the New Testament) from the very beginning and 
			earliest (Genesis, 1400 B.C. ) to the very end  and latest (Revelation, A.D. 95).  Important, too, is that Jesus Christ Himself interacted with and spoke of angels 
			with the assumption and knowledge that they indeed do exist (Matthew 4:11; 22:29-30; 24:36; 25:31,41;  Luke 22:43).</p>
	<p>So for the Bible-believing Christian, this question really need not even be asked.  We believe in God, we believe His word, that it is accurate and true, and so we believe 
			in the angels that the scriptures reveal to us.</p>

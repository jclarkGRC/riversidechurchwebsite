	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	background: #666666;
	margin: 0; /* it's good practice to zero the margin and padding of the body element to account for differing browser defaults */

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/

	background: #FFFFFF;

	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.

.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */

	float: right;

    <h1> A Brief Study of Angels</h1>
    <h2><em>Where do angels dwell? </em></h2>
    <p>Since they are actual, personal beings we assume that angels need or would at least desire a place to live and call home.  The short and quick answer is, of course, that 
    		they dwell in heaven.  Several biblical references seem to make this clear (Matthew 28:2; Mark 13:32; Luke 2:13; Galatians 1:8).  When coming to earth they start from 
    		heaven and are generally identified with heaven.  That’s easy enough to start.</p>
	<p>But now we ask a little tougher question--<b>which</b> heaven?  This may surprise some of us but the Bible teaches that there are three heavens.  Paul spoke of this fact 
			in II Corinthians 12:1-4.  Now the question becomes--what did Paul mean by <i>“the third heaven”</i>?  Jewish literature of a later era makes reference to a popular 
			belief in seven heavens but it is not certain that this view was around in Paul’s day.  Today, Mormons believe in three heavens (terrestrial, celestial and telestial) 
			in which different classifications of “the worthy” will be placed according to their works.  Their view, however, is foreign to the Bible which teaches that all true 
			believers will someday dwell with the Lord Jesus forever (John 14:1-3; I Thessalonians 4:17).  Nevertheless, this phrase of Paul's may cause us a little uncertainty or 
			uneasiness.</p>
	<p>It is not something to get worked up about.  Most conservative scholars believe that Paul was simply making a reference to the “highest heaven” of the three that  we 
			already recognize.  The first heaven would be the atmospheric heaven around the earth where the birds fly and the clouds float.  The second heaven would be space which 
			the moon, other planets, stars and other bodies occupy.  The third heaven, then, is the dwelling place of God which Paul makes clear in v. 4 by also referring to it as 
			Paradise (cf. Luke 23:43).</p>
	<p>Most people simply assume that all the angels also dwell in the third heaven.  However, not all evangelical scholars agree with that.  It does seem that some angels in 
			their service to God are with Him in the third heaven most, if not all, of the time.  Some of these would perhaps include the seraphim of Isaiah 6:1-6; the living 
			creatures of Ezekiel 1 and Revelation 4; and Gabriel in Luke 1:19.</p>
	<p>But from things implied by other scriptures some scholars believe that the majority of angels make their dwelling in the second heaven though they may have ready access 
			to the third heaven (Job 1:6; 2:1).  We have already seen that Jesus was made <i>“a little lower than the angels”</i> (Hebrews 2:9).  In addition to (or perhaps instead 
			of) seeing this as a reference to becoming human, which is a lower order of creation with regard to power and abilities, they also see it as a reference to the fact 
			that Jesus had to pass through the realm of the angels and dwell under it in order to become fully man.  Linking this to Hebrews 4:14 which states that completing 
			His work by having <i>“passed through the heavens”</i> (or, in other words, He came to earth and then ascended back to heaven), some take this to mean that the abode 
			of angels may be in the starry realm instead of the highest heaven.  They also point to statements made in Isaiah 14:12-14 which are attributed to Lucifer (Satan) 
			as he decided to try to overthrow God and assume His position.  Notice v. 13 which states <i>“I will ascend into heaven”</i> which again implies that his dwelling 
			place was usually lower than the third heaven.</p>
	<p>One more thing about this that Robert Lightner shares which, though speculative, is still interesting.  In chapter 13 of <i>Angels, Satan and Demons</i> which tries to 
			answer commonly asked questions about angels and demons, he poses: <i>“Is there a relationship between angels and stars?”</i> (p. 171).  Acknowledging that there 
			have been many <i>“fanciful and far-fetched views”</i>, he nevertheless asserts that the “Bible does seem to relate angels to stars, but it also keeps them 
			distinct.” </p>
	<p>Sometimes when the Old Testament writers used the Hebrew word for stars they give the impression that they are more than just impersonal bodies made of gases, minerals 
			or other materials.  They are given personal characteristics (Judges 5:20; Job 25:5; 38:7; Psalm 148:3).  This sort of thing is also present in the New Testament 
			(I Cor. 15:40-41; Jude 13.  We should note here that some of those same characteristics or personifications are also applied to other parts of the creation without 
			anyone suggesting that they, too, are angels or other real personal beings.  Using these scriptures this way seems somewhat inconsistent).  Some believe that the 
			star which led the wise men to the place where Jesus lay was perhaps an angel of light assigned by God to reveal the location of the Christ child.  Probably the 
			strongest reference to stars which is often understood to be referring to angels is in Revelation 12:3-4a.  Here the <i>“third of the stars of heaven”</i> is 
			commonly associated with the rebellious fallen angels who chose to follow Lucifer.  But it is not certain that this is the correct interpretation.</p>
	<p>Lightner concludes with a quotation from James Woychuck which offers the correct observation that if there is some mysterious relationship between stars and angels then 
			it is probable we will never understand it in this life.  He further states that if nothing else the multitude of stars can be to us a constant visualization and/or 
			a reminder of the multitude of angels who are indeed God’s hosts and His armies of light whom He uses on our behalf and for our benefit.</p>
	<p>The bottom line is that the issue of whether angels make their primary residence in the second or third heaven is mostly irrelevant for us.  We do not need to take a 
			firm position on the matter nor do we need to <i>dwell</i> on it (get it? Ha!).  But as long as we are doing the study I thought I’d mention it.</p>

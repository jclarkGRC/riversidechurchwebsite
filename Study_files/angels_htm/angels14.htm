	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/

	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;

.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */

    <h1> A Brief Study of Angels</h1>
    <h2><em>What is the destiny of demons?</em></h2>
    <p>Regarding fallen angels, this is probably the question with the shortest and most straightforward answer.  There are only a couple of considerations to pose about the 
    	future of demons.  One of them has to do with whether or not there is a possibility they can change.  We also looked at this when we were studying the same issue about 
    	the holy angels except in reverse.  There we asked if it is possible or likely that angels could experience another time where some decide to rebel against God and fall 
    	from their holy state.  Here we must turn it around and wonder whether some or all of the demons might repent of their disobedience and be restored to God’s service.  
    	As before, we assert that this possibility seems highly unlikely.  Though we cannot assume that the angelic experience and the human experience are the same in this 
    	regard, it seems logical to assume that as death marks the point of no return for a human so the choice to follow Satan was also irrevocable for the angels who chose 
    	to do so.  Though obviously we cannot know everything that happens in the spiritual, supernatural realm, it is significant that there is not even a hint in the Bible 
    	that such a repentance by demons is conceivable.  In all the recorded meetings between Jesus and fallen angels, the contention seems to be absolute and final.  There 
    	is no mention at all of any possibility of reconciliation.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of the destiny of demons involves something we have previously discussed and will only mention quickly here.  Some think that some fallen angels will be 
    	released from imprisonment to participate in a coming Tribulation period (Rev. 9:1-11; 13-19).  We mention this because it is future, however, it only involves certain 
    	demons (though others currently free will no doubt be  extremely active during that time) and, if true, it is for a very short time before their final destination.</p>
    <p>Which brings us to that truth made abundantly clear in the Bible about the destiny of demons, which is, they are doomed.  We see them connected with Satan in Revelation 
    	12:9 and cast out of heaven.  In Matthew 25:41 as Jesus described the fate of the goats (those who do not serve Him), Jesus reveals the final fate of these evil beings 
    	who have opposed Him for thousands of years.  It is described as a place of “<i>everlasting fire</i>" which people generally refer to as Hell.  They are not going there 
    	to rule, nor will they thrive and enjoy it.  It is a place of punishment and torment for all who are consigned there, whether human or angelic.  Though it satisfies 
    	God’s justice, it is yet sad to contemplate that any being must go there.  It must be  terrifying to know that your future in such a place is sealed with no hope of 
    	avoiding it.  I guess that explains James 2:19.</p>

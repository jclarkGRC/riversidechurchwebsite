	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/

	background: #FFFFFF;

	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;

    <h1> A Brief Study of Angels</h1>
    <h2><em>Where do demons come from?</em></h2>
    <p><img src="images/attachment.jpg" alt="Fallen Angel" width="185" height="301" hspace="10" align="left" />Among those who do accept the existence of demons there are 
    		various views with regard to their origin.  In ancient times, many thought that such beings were the spirits of deceased wicked people.  According to Merrill Unger, 
    		this thinking was popularized by Greek thought and culture and, among others, the Jewish historian, Josephus, took this view (<i>Demons in the World Today</i>, 
    		p. 11).  Some still believe this just as many believe that holy angels are the spirits of good people.  Of course we have already seen from Jesus’ account of the 
    		rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-31 that the spirits of people who die have a destination to one of two places.  They are not left to wander the world making 
    		mischief (or helping the living).</p>
	<p>Another view among some is that demons are the disembodied spirits of a pre-Adamic race.  That is to say, some believe that God created a race of men prior to Adam.  
			But, according to them, God destroyed this race and their world completely and started over (which, they say, is where Genesis 1:3 picks up).  However, their 
			spirits survived and became what we know today as demons.  Those who believe this make a sharp distinction between the words <i>“angels</i>” and <i>“spirits</i>” 
			in order to support their view.  They  assert that <i>“spirits”</i> always refers to <b>human</b> spirits while <i>“angels”</i> are beings God created separately. 
			In light of Hebrews 1:14 this alleged distinction is certainly questionable and very refutable.  It must also be noted that there is no scripture which supports 
			the concept of a pre-Adamic race whatsoever.  Also, there must be an presupposed gap between Genesis 1:1 and v. 2 in which all the rebellion, destruction and the 
			resultant chaos occurred.  Proponents of this theory sometimes point to the use of the Greek word for demons in the New Testament.  In classical Greek literature 
			its meaning was <i>“the good spirits of departed men of the golden age”</i> (Unger, <i>Demons in the World Today</i>, p. 12).  However that usage was several hundred 
			years before the writing of the New Testament and the meaning of the word had changed before it was used by the Apostles and other writers.  This view has very little 
			(if anything) to recommend it.>
	<p>Still another view is that demons are the offspring of an unnatural union between the <i>“sons of God”</i> (wicked angels) and the <i>“daughters of men”</i> (human women) 
			recorded in Genesis 6:1-4.  The theory is that the children of this union were wiped out in the flood which followed and their spirits became the demons.  If we assume, 
			for argument’s sake, that this is the correct interpretation (angels sexually cohabiting with women), still we are faced with the fact that nowhere does the Bible 
			address what became of the offspring after their deaths.  Obviously this view of the origin of demons is highly speculative.  (More later on the Genesis 6:1-4 passage.)</p>
	<p>These are all minority views based on incorrect ideas about the Bible or filling in where God’s word is silent.  Now in the interest of honesty and accuracy, we must admit 
			that there is no specific passage in the Bible that spells out in plain, simple terms exactly where demons do come from.  Some of the background details related to 
			this matter are definitely sketchy. But the Bible does provide information which helps us deduce a much more reasonable explanation than the ones above.  The majority 
			view among fundamental Christians is that demons were originally angels who fell from their holy state by committing sin against God.</p>
	<p>When did this happen?  We cannot place a precise date on it just as we could not say exactly when holy angels were created.  However, we can make some general deductions 
			based on what we know from the Bible.  Scripture reveals that these beings are directly connected to Satan (Matt. 12:24-26; 25:41; Luke 10:17-20; Rev. 12:7).  
			Therefore it seems logical to assume that these angels (also called <i>“spirits”</i> and <i>“unclean spirits”</i> by Jesus--cf. Matt. 17:18 and Mark 9:25) fell at 
			the same time Satan did by joining him in his rebellion against God (more on this when we focus on Satan).  The only other specific detail with regard to the timing 
			of their fall that we can nail down is that it occurred before the fall of Adam and Eve in Eden since Satan was the instigator there (cf. Gen. 3; Rev. 20:2).</p>
	<p>How many angels fell from their state of holiness to become demons?  We are given no exact number but there is a passage that may address this issue to some degree.  
			Some think that Revelation 12:4a is a reference to the angels who fell with Satan.  You may remember that we talked about how there seems to be some sort of 
			connection in the Bible between angels and the stars (though we dare not make too much of it).  Here is a verse that may be making that link.  If indeed this is the 
			meaning (and many do not believe it is) then about one third of all the angels God created fell along with Satan.  How many is that? Again, we have no exact numbers 
			but previously we concluded that based on biblical language (<i>“hosts, thousands of thousands, myriads”</i>) there are millions and perhaps billions or even trillions 
			of angels.  A third of a number like that would be sizeable and would be consistent with other Bible passages (cf. Mark 5:8-9) and also with the prolific evil we see 
			in the world around us.</p>
	<p>To sum up, God created all the angels perfect and holy.  But just as with man at a later time, some of them decided to disbelieve and rebel against God.  These were cast 
			out and became thoroughly wicked.  Though we have no way of knowing exactly how many demons there are, it seems logical that there are multitudes of them.  This is 
			the most likely (and most biblically sound) answer to the question of where demons come from.</p>

body  {
	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	background: #666666;
	margin: 0; /* it's good practice to zero the margin and padding of the body element to account for differing browser defaults */

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/

	background: #FFFFFF;

	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */
}  

/* Miscellaneous classes for reuse */
.fltrt { /* this class can be used to float an element right in your page. The floated element must precede the element it should be next to on the page. */
	float: right;
	margin-left: 8px;
}
.fltlft { /* this class can be used to float an element left in your page */
	float: left;
	margin-right: 8px;
}
.clearfloat { /* this class should be placed on a div or break element and should be the final element before the close of a container that should fully contain a float */

    <h1> A Brief Study of Angels</h1>
    <h2><em>What is the destiny of angels? </em></h2>
    <p>It seems somewhat presumptuous to be commenting on the final disposition of beings who have been in existence and active since before the world was created while we have 
    		only been around a few decades.  But of course, we are not relying on our own experience or knowledge to speculate on what will become of angels.  That would be 
    		foolish indeed.  Any insight we have must come from the only reliable source we have for such matters--the Bible.</p>
	<p>But frankly the Bible does not have much to say about this issue.  However, we should probably address a couple of matters with regard to the holy angels and what their 
			future role will be.  First, since there was an time in the past when some of the angels rebelled against the Lord (Luke 10:17-18; Revelation 12:7-9) we could pose 
			the question of whether there might be another such occasion.  In other words, is it possible that the holy angels can still fall?  The consensus among conservative 
			scholars is that, like humans, angels had a probationary period during which they chose the one to whom they would give their allegiance.  For humans, we refer to 
			this period as our “life.”  At death the probationary period is over and we will be confirmed (so to speak) in our choice between following God or following something 
			else (Luke 16:19-31).  So after the point of death a human's  destiny is fixed and there is no changing it.  Most believe that the holy angels were likewise confirmed 
			in their allegiance to God when they rejected the lies and influence of Lucifer at the time of the rebellion.  But note that in this case we are taking the biblical 
			teachings about man’s destiny and applying them to angels.  We cannot be sure that they are perfectly aligned but it seems reasonable.</p>
	<p>Another question has to do with what angels will be doing in the eternal state.  Since Hebrews 1:14 makes it clear that a major role for them is <i>“to minister for those 
			who will inherit salvation”</i> what will they do after all believing humans have inherited salvation?  Once again we must admit that the Scriptures do not speak to 
			this issue even as they do not speak very clearly to what we humans will be doing in eternity.  It may be that some will continue in their present capacity since proclaiming God’s glory certainly does not need to cease (Isaiah 6:1-3).  But no doubt God will find something for them to do just as He will give each of us meaningful roles in His Kingdom.</p>
	<p>Finally, the Bible says that we are <i>“made...a little lower than the angels”</i> (Psalm 8:5; Hebrews 2:7).  Will it be true all through eternity that angels are 
			inherently superior to us?  Not necessarily.  Some believe that upon receiving glorified bodies we will receive similar powers and attributes to those possessed by 
			angels.  Thus, if true, at that point they would not be on a higher level than us--at least in that way.  Some go further and say that since angels were not created 
			in the image of God (at least they are never described that way as man is in Genesis 1:26-27), that in the eternal state we will actually assume the superior position.  
			They point to I Corinthians 6:3 to bolster this claim and assert that we will be placed in authority over the angels in heaven.  Some think that perhaps because God 
			has indicated that at least some of us will be assigned to places of authority (Luke 19:16-19) that angels will be employed in service to those rulers or perhaps even 
			just in helping  in whatever tasks we are given.  However, that verse about judging angels could be speaking of judging fallen angels and may not necessarily mean that 
			we will rule over the holy angels.</p>
	<p>This concludes the section on the holy angels.  Next we will look at the doctrine of fallen angels and of Satan.</p>

	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust these divs based on your final font sizing.
*/

	background: #FFFFFF;

	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 {
	float: right; 
	width: 12em; /* since this element is floated, a width must be given */
	background: #EBEBEB; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
}
.twoColElsRt #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsRt #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.
*/
.twoColElsRt #mainContent {
	margin: 0 13em 0 1.5em; /* the left margin can be given in ems or pixels. It creates the space down the left side of the page. */

	float: right;

    <h1> A Brief Study of Angels</h1>
    <h2><em>What do angels do and how does it affect us as humans? </em></h2>
    <p>As we have observed earlier, with the current day craze about angels in the society, there is much information available about what functions angels perform.  Much of 
    		this is pure speculation and is not based on the Bible at all or is an exaggeration of what the Bible does say.  For instance, Robert Lightner shares that some 
    		believe that twelve angels are assigned to be governors of the Zodiac and watch over the twelve months of the year.  Further, some believe that there are certain 
    		angels for each day of the week and even each hour of the day.  Others think that angels are assigned to protect animals both wild and tame and also the birds 
    		(with the dove alone having its own exclusive guardian).  This goes on and on with some people contending that angels are assigned to plants and trees (to help 
    		them grow right); the nations, states and cities (to guide and help make successful); and the weather and the seasons (<i>Angels, Satan and Demons</i>, pp. 49-50).</p>
	<p>Of course, as we have already stated, we are interested in getting our information from God’s word.  Although not all our questions may be answered by the Bible about 
			angels, it does have a lot to say and we can trust that what it says is true. Let us begin by noting that it seems that some angels are made for special functions or 
			are created to be in special classifications.  We have already seen two of these special types of angels, namely the <i>cherubim</i> and the <i>seraphim</i>.  
			Cherubim are seen in Genesis 3:24 and Ezekiel 10:1-22 (seen earlier in Ezekiel 1 but not named).  The golden figures above the mercy seat of the Ark were cherubim 
			(Exodus 25:17-22). They have an extraordinary appearance with four faces with each respectively having the characteristics of a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle.  
			They also have  four wings and are said to be “full of eyes.”  The specific function of the cherubim when we seen them seems to be that of protecting God’s glory 
			and holiness.</p>
	<p>Seraphim are seen only in Isaiah 6:1-7 where the prophet is having a vision of the temple of God in heaven.  The word <i>seraphim</i> means <i>burning ones</i>.  They 
			are described as having six wings.  Their function seems to be proclaiming the holiness and glory of the Lord.  There are other angels and groups of angels which 
			seem to be reserved for certain duties who are unnamed (Rev. 8:2-3; 14:17-18; 15:1; 20:1-3).  However, we cannot say for certain that this is all they were created 
			to do. For that matter, the same can be said of the cherubim and seraphim.  It may be that these angels have more than just one task no matter what type they are.</p>
	<p>Another aspect of what angels do is necessarily determined by their <i>rank</i>.  Just as the mail clerk of a business has different responsibilities than the CEO, so it 
			would seem that angels also differ in their tasks according to where God has placed them in His service.  That they are ranked is made clear in the scriptures.  In 
			Jude 9 we see that Michael is designated as an <i>archangel</i>.  As far as we know this is the highest rank possible for angels.  Is Michael the only archangel?  
			Possibly, but in Daniel 10:13 he (if it’s the same one) is also referred to as <i>one of the chief princes</i> which implies that there are others of his rank 
			(cf. I Thess. 4:16).  Michael’s main task seems to be overseer and guardian of God’s chosen people Israel.  This is implied in Daniel 10:21when, while speaking to 
			Daniel, Gabriel referred to Michael as <i>your prince</i>.  In Revelation 12:7 we also see Michael leading the holy angels in battle against Satan and his angels.  
			He seems to be a powerful angel involved in spiritual warfare.<p>
	<p>What other evidence  is there that angels possess rank?  Seven different times in his epistles Paul mentions the organization and ranking of angels by using words like 
			<i>principalities, powers, dominions, thrones, rulers and might</i>.  The context determines whether he is speaking of holy or fallen angels.  For now we will 
			consider only the holy angels which seem to be referred to in Ephesians 1:21; 3:10 and Colossians 1:16; 2:10.  Some (like Frank Peretti in his book <i>This Present 
			Darkness</i>, for instance) take these and other statements to mean that certain angels are given responsibility and authority over certain geographical locations 
			in the world beginning perhaps in neighborhoods and ascending in rank all the way up through cities, counties, states and even to entire nations and larger areas.  
			The fact that Michael seems to have a special relationship with Israel bolsters this claim.  However, it may also be that God assigned Michael to Israel because He 
			knew that they would be especially targeted by Satan because of their status as God’s chosen people.  It does not <i>necessarily</i> mean that every city, nation, 
			etc. has an angel assigned to them.  We cannot know for sure either way.</p>
	<p>What Paul’s words <i>do</i> mean is that the angels are ranked in some fashion and that there is a hierarchy of authority and power.  As with anything else, to operate 
			effectively you must be organized.  Apparently this is the case with the angels.  Some plan, some lead, some execute orders--perhaps similarly to a human army.</p>
	<p>Which brings us to the sorts of orders and missions that the holy angels carry out in relationship to humans.  According to the Bible angels have been very active in the 
			affairs of mankind (both those who served God faithfully and those who did not.)  Let’s start with examples of those who did not believe or serve God.  We can 
			probably sum up what angels do in relationship to unbelievers in a single word-- judgment.  With regard to wickedness and evil people when angels are mentioned it 
			is usually in connection with punishment God has ordained. Angels were involved in the judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:12-13);  they were used in the 
			destruction of Egypt (Psalm 78:49);  also in the punishment of Jerusalem for idolatry (Ezekiel 9:1-6);  and again to strike Herod for his evil (Acts 12:21-23).  
			Jesus makes it clear that the angels will assist in the final judgment (Matt. 13:39-42).  And we have already seen in Revelation how the angels sounded the trumpets 
			and poured out the bowl judgments shown there.</p>
	<p>Another aspect of their actions toward unbelievers is that angels are also used to proclaim truth in a limited way. Once again in Revelation we see angels making 
			announcements about what was to come and urging the hearers to repent (Rev. 8:13; 14:6).  If we see the shepherds of Luke 2 as unbelievers, then angels were used 
			to proclaim the <i>“good tidings”</i> of Jesus (Luke 2:9-14).</p>
	<p>Their actions toward true believers are more varied and certainly more positive.  We can see, however, that all of their doings can be summed up in a word from 
			Hebrews 1:14--<i>ministry</i>.  They are sometimes used by God on the behalf of believers when it is in His will to do so.  They have benefitted God’s people in many 
			ways among which are:  protection (Daniel 6:22; Acts 12:11);  provision (I Kings 19:57);  direction (Acts 5:19-20; 8:26; 10:1-5) and encouragement (Acts 27:23-25).</p>
	<p>Let’s briefly explore a related question to how angels care for and minister to believers.  <i>Are there such things as guardian angels?</i>  Different people have 
			different ideas about this issue.  Some believe they are assigned only to children.  Some believe each child has only one while others think several angels are 
			assigned  to each child.  Some believe that it is not a specific personal thing but rather some angels have been assigned to care for children in general.  The key 
			verse for this doctrine is found in Matthew 18:10.  However this could just as easily mean that instead of attending the children that angels represent them before 
			God in heaven.</p>
	<p>But what about adults?  Do they not receive aid from angels?  We have already seen that they do minister to adults.  We cannot know for sure whether each individual has 
			a personal guardian angel assigned for him.  What we can know for sure is that the Lord God loves us and watches over us.  Ultimately it is He who protects, provides, 
			directs, encourages, guards and saves us.  Even as we are focusing on and studying this doctrine of angels we must keep in mind that they are merely God’s 
			<i>messengers</i> (Hebrew <i>malak</i>; Greek <i>angelos</i>).  They are His representatives to us and can only do what He has authorized and empowered them to do.  
			To God be the glory for all that He has done for us.</p>
	<p>One last question.  Are angels still doing the same things today that they did in Bible days?  We must bear in mind that we know for sure that angels have discontinued 
			doing at least one thing.  They do not carry messages directly from God to humans anymore.  Why not?  Because if they did then the Scriptures are not complete.  
			God has given us the inspired, inerrant, infallible Bible to guide us.  If we obey that we will be on the right path.  If this is true, then it is possible that 
			angels have discontinued other activities as well.  My personal belief is that angels operate on the edge of normal circumstances.  What I mean is that they work 
			behind the scenes on behalf of believers and in accordance with God’s will.  For skeptics there is nothing there to be seen that would mandate or necessitate a 
			belief in the supernatural.  For Christians we see certain circumstances and situations as being manipulated, controlled or influenced by God on our behalf--perhaps 
			by using His agents, the angels.  Working in this manner, they insure that a belief in angels is still a matter of faith in what God has told us in His word, the 
			Bible.</p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charles Taze Russell was born on February 16, 1852 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania near
				Pittsburgh.  He spent most of his childhood as a member of the local Congregationalist Church which has its roots in Puritanism.  Possibly
				in part because of its severe teachings, at an early age, Russell rejected the doctrine of eternal torment in a lake of fire for unbelievers.
				Horowitz, who, by the way, is sympathetic to Russell, writes that "<i>the pessimistic Calvinist faith ... was too frightening for the deeply
				religious young man.</i>”  (Pastor Russell, p. 24)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1870 he was exposed to the teachings of William Miller who had founded what was called
				the Second Adventist movement around the turn of the century and also to the teachings John Thomas who founded a group called the
				Christadelphians in 1848.  From the Millerites Russell was provided with an official religious denial of hell and an emphasis on
				sensational end time prophecies and events (Miller had incorrectly predicted that Christ would return in 1848).  From the Christadelphians
				he learned that Jesus Christ is not God and that the Holy Spirit is only a power or force, not a Person.  These teachings would influence
				him greatly as he formed his own Bible class in Pittsburgh.  In 1876 this group elected him as “Pastor” (however he was never officially
				ordained by any recognized religious body).  He began writing in earnest and in 1877 in a work entitled <i>Three Worlds</i> predicted that
				the current world system would soon end in a great battle (Armageddon) and the kingdom of God would begin.  (He later reaffirmed this
				"prophecy" in <i>The Time is at Hand</i> written in 1889 and fixed the date as the year 1914. This was often repeated in his other writings.)
				In 1879 he established <i>The Herald of the Morning</i>, a regular publication which developed into what we know today as <i>The
				Watchtower</i>.  His group was organized as the <i>International Bible Students Association</i>.  In 1881 he founded and in 1884
				incorporated the <i>Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society</i> which became the publishing arm of his rapidly growing group.  Through this entity
				he published a series of six books originally titled <i>The Millennial Dawn</i> but later renamed <i>Studies in the Scriptures</i> which
				remain important to JW theology. In 1908, the headquarters was moved to Brooklyn, New York where it remains today.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the midst of all this, Russell’s life and character should be mentioned.  (Most of the
				following material comes from Martin, <i>Kingdom</i>, pp. 39-46.)  In 1897, his wife Maria left him.  In 1903 she sought legal separation
				and was awarded such by the courts in 1906.  In 1909 Russell was required to make a one-time alimony payment of $6036.  In the course of
				this legal action it was revealed that all the money given to or raised by the Watch Tower Society was funneled through a holding company
				in which Russell controlled ninety-nine percent of the stock.  The other one percent was shared by two of his followers.  Thus he controlled
				all the wealth of this organization and was accountable to no one.  After re-locating to Brooklyn, several of his antics came under the
				scrutiny of the local paper, <i>The Brooklyn Daily Eagle</i>.  One incident involved Russell’s promotion and sell of "Miracle Wheat” seed
				for an exorbitant $1.00 a pound claiming it would grow five times as much wheat as normal seed.  Followers were advised to purchase it with
				the proceeds going, of course, to the Watch Tower.  The paper lampooned this venture and Russell brought suit for libel.  In the course of
				the trial, government agents tested the seed and found it to be low in quality.  Russell lost the suit.  The paper also investigated some
				of Russell’s world tours during which he claimed to speak extensively to large crowds with great results.  Although he did travel,
				<i>The Eagle</i> discovered that many of the alleged sermons did not in fact occur.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One other case bears mentioning.  In 1912, a Baptist pastor named J.J. Ross from Hamilton,
				Ontario wrote, as Martin puts it, "<i>a blistering pamphlet denouncing Russell’s theology and personal life</i>" (<i>Kingdom</i>, p. 42) .
				Of course, Russell again brought a lawsuit claiming he had been defamed and libeled.  (It’s interesting to note that though Russell attacked
				earthly governments and laws as tools of Satan, he often sought to avail himself of their protections when it seemed advantageous to do so.)
				Part of Ross’ article focused on Russell’s lack of education regarding Hebrew and Greek in which he claimed to be expert (cf. comments by
				Horowitz, <i>Pastor Russell</i>, p. 12).  During the trial he was forced to admit that he had only attended public school for seven years,
				having dropped out at age 14.  Under examination Russell contradicted and perjured himself and was finally forced to admit he did not know
				either Greek or Hebrew.  He lost the case at every point.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The year 1914 was, of course, much anticipated by Russell and his followers and though there
				were some earthshaking events, his prophecies did not come to pass as he originally predicted (cf. Horowitz, <i>Pastor Russell</i>, p. 26).
				The first way they dealt with it was to reprint <i>The Time is at Hand</i> in 1915 and simply change the prophetic year from 1914 to 1915.
				Of course, as we know the war in Europe raged on until 1918 so that did not help.  So he began teaching (as is taught today) that the kingdom
				of God was fully set up in heaven, not on earth as he originally proclaimed.  Russell continued in his capacity as leader of this movement
				until his death on October 31, 1916.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge Joseph Franklin Rutherford assumed the mantle of leadership after Russell’s death.
				He was lead counsel for the Watch Tower Society and acted as Russell’s lawyer in his many court cases.  Although never elected or appointed
				as a permanent judge, he maintained the title because early in his career he was elected by his fellow lawyers as a temporary judge in the
				Eighth Judicial Circuit Court of Booneville, Missouri for a period of about four days.  Rutherford also made some prophecies concerning the
				end of the current world system and the beginning of the kingdom of God.  On September 1, 1922 he predicted 1925 as the year in which it
				would happen.  He, too, was wrong.  After these two colossal failures, the Watch Tower became more cautious about setting dates but no less
				enthusiastic about proclaiming how near the end was.  From 1930-39 numerous printed declarations were made.  From May, 1940 to April 15,
				1943 the Society made at least 44 statements about the imminence of Armageddon. (cf. <i>Cult Watch</i>, pp. 81-82).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under Rutherford the leadership of the Society became even more authoritarian.  To oppose
				him became tantamount to opposing Jehovah Himself.  However, his reign was not without its rough spots.  In 1917 Rutherford caused some of
				Russell’s previously unpublished notes to be edited and printed as a seventh volume of <i>Studies in the Scriptures</i>.  This volume was
				controversial among the movement and caused a split.  Most followed Rutherford while the smaller group became known as <i>The Dawn Bible
				Students Association</i>.  In 1928 Rutherford publicly and officially rejected Russell’s underlying ideas regarding the 1914 prediction.
				Russell believed that the thousands of inches in the passageways of the Great Pyramid near Cairo, Egypt represented years which helped him
				come to his final calculations (Herbert Kern, <i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, pp. 44-45).  Once again the Society lost members.
				There were other incidents along the way.  Rutherford died in 1942.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It should be noted that it was under Rutherford that the International Bible Students
				Association and the Watch Tower Society were merged to form the present religious corporation.  The name <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses</i> was
				adopted in 1931.  It is interesting that loyal followers of Russell who split away from Rutherford deny that Russell founded the Jehovah’s
				Witnesses (technically true) and do not like his name to be associated with them (Horowitz, <i>Pastor Russell</i>, pp. 70-71). At the same
				time, because of the undeniable moral and ethical failings of Russell himself, current day JW’s do not like to be associated with him either.
				It would seem to be a mutually beneficial arrangement except that whatever the technicalities are, the current day theology of the JW’s is
				mainly based on Russell’s teachings and writings.  Martin documents the extent of references to Russell’s writings after his death by later
				JW leaders and teachers (<i>Kingdom</i>, pp. 49-51) and also does a side-by-side comparison of Russell’s teachings and current JW beliefs
				(<i>Kingdom</i>, pp. 57-61).  He says that <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses have never stopped being "Russellites", no matter how loudly they proclaim
				the opposite</i>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third president of the Jehovah’s Witnesses was Nathan Homer Knorr.  Under his
				leadership the Gilead Missionary Training School was established in South Lansing, New York.  Also in 1961 the New World Translation of the
				Bible was completed.  (The five members of the translation committee were Knorr, Frederick Franz, Albert Schroeder, George Gangas and Milton
				Henschel).  Only Franz had any exposure to biblical languages having studied Greek for two years at the University of Cincinnati and being
				self-taught in Hebrew.  In a court case in Edinborough, Scotland on November 23, 1954, Franz testified that God supervised their translation
				efforts by means of "angels of various ranks who control" the translators.  The number of members grew from around 105,000 to 2.2 million.
				Much of the growth happened after 1966 when Franz again predicted that Armageddon and the establishment of God’s kingdom would occur in
				1975.  Many members even sold their homes and belongings in anticipation of the event.  Once again it failed to happen and they lost many
				members.  Knorr died in June, 1977.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In wrapping up the historical section we note that Knorr was succeeded by Frederick W.
				Franz.  He had to deal with much independent thinking of members who then usually left the movement.  Even his own nephew, Raymond, left
				and wrote an scathing expose of the JW’s entitled <i>Crisis of Confidence</i>.  Franz was followed in 1992 by Milton G. Henschel.  Despite
				having to deal with some of the same issues, they continue to grow (worldwide membership at approximately 2.5 million according to
				<i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 57, published in 1991, though the January 1, 1995 issue of <i>The Watchtower</i> claims 4.9 million) and pose a
				problem for traditional Christianity and for the many souls deluded by their doctrine.</font></p>

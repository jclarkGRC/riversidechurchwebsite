			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though we have previously briefly referred to what Jehovah’s Witnesses say about the
				resurrection and the return of Christ, it is probably best that we dedicate a small section to these vital doctrines so as to be perfectly
				clear on what they believe and what the Bible teaches.  We will consider them together because the way one sees the resurrection greatly
				influences what one believes about His return.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, let’s be reminded of what the JW’s believe about Jesus’ resurrection.  The gist of
				it is that his body was not raised but rather he was brought back to life as a spirit.  Walter Martin shares the following quotations from
				<i>Let God Be True</i>:
				<blockquote>
					<i>... Jehovah God raised him from the dead, not as a human Son, but as a mighty immortal spirit Son ... For forty days after that he
					materialized, as angels before him had done, to show himself alive to his disciples ...</i> (p. 40); <i>...Jesus did not take his human body
					to heaven to be forever a man in heaven.  Had he done so, that would have left him ever lower than the angels. ... God did not purpose
					for Jesus to be humiliated thus forever by being a fleshly man forever.  No, but after he had sacrificed his perfect manhood, God raised
					him to deathless life as a glorious spirit creature.</i> (p. 41);  <i>This firstborn from the dead was raised from the grave, not a human
					creature, but a spirit.</i> (p. 276).  (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, pp. 54-55.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What did happen to Jesus’ body if it was not raised?  Charles Russell asserts in <i>Studies
				in the Scriptures</i> (Vol. V, p. 454) that it either
				<blockquote>
					<i>dissolved into gases or ... is preserved somewhere as the grand memorial of God’s love</i> (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 97).
				</blockquote>
				Herbert Kern observes that the September 1, 1953 edition of <i>The Watchtower</i> proclaims that it
				<blockquote>
					<i>was disposed of by Jehovah God, dissolved into its constituent elements or atoms</i> (<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>,
					p. 34).
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the more important question concerns why JW’s believe this to be true.  What is their
				reasoning that makes this belief necessary?  There seem to be two main points they make.  The first has to do with the ransom Jesus paid.
				Since he was paying for sin by suffering in the flesh, this means that he could not resume possession of that fleshly body at a later time.
				The following quotation from <i>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</i> (p. 143) makes this clear:
				<blockquote>
					<i>... having given up his flesh for the life of the world, Christ could never take it again and become a man once more</i> (<i>How to Respond
					to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 34).
				</blockquote>
				But, as Kern points out, this is in direct contradiction to what Jesus said in <b>John 10:17-18</b>.  Some might argue that when Jesus
				said "<i>life</i>" in those verses, he was not necessarily talking about his fleshly body.  However, <b>John 2:19-21</b> makes it very clear
				that Jesus was anticipating the physical resurrection of his body.  In the book <i>Things in Which It is Impossible for God to Lie</i>,
				JW’s state that
				<blockquote>
					<i>The human body of flesh, which Jesus Christ laid down forever as a ransom sacrifice, was disposed of by God’s power but not by fire on
					the altar of the temple in Jerusalem.  The flesh of a sacrifice is always disposed of and put out of existence, so not corrupting ...</i>
					(David Reed, <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>, p. 70).
				</blockquote>
				Here they make the connection between the Levitical offerings and Jesus’ sacrifice.  While it is true that the procedure of the burnt offering
				and the sin offering required the complete destruction of the flesh through fire and that they did point ahead to the sacrifice that Jesus
				would one day make for our sin, it is a bit much to declare that His body, too, must also be completely destroyed.  We must remember that
				in the case of the offering of animals, it would be possible that they could be killed as a sacrifice but continue to serve by providing
				flesh to eat (indeed some of the other sacrifices allow for that).  But a characteristic of sacrifices like these is that they must be
				given wholly to God with no return to man, so the meat is consumed by fire.  There was no need for Jesus’ body to be burned up or destroyed
				in some other manner as if it was going to be of profit to someone somehow.  The picture of the burnt offerings is fulfilled as is -- Jesus
				gave himself wholly and completely, holding nothing back, taking the full measure of God’s wrath on the cross.  He gave his life.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second reason they teach a spiritual rather than a bodily resurrection seems to hinge
				on their understanding (or rather misunderstanding) of <b>I Corinthians 15:50</b> which says "<i>... that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
				Kingdom of God</i>” (Kern, <i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 34).  Since Jesus inherited the kingdom of God, then it must
				follow that he does not have a fleshly body.  However, in the context Paul is not talking about Jesus’ body but rather he is talking about
				ours.  Paul is saying that our present weak, sinful, corrupt bodies are not fit for heaven and eternity -- "<i>... nor does corruption inherit
				incorruption</i>".  The subsequent verses make it exceedingly clear that our own bodies will be raised and made into that which is fit for
				heaven.  It does not say that our bodies will be left to dissolve but that they will be "<i>changed</i>" and that they will "<i>put on
				incorruption, and ... immortality</i>." Earlier in the chapter Paul said that Jesus "<i>has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen
				asleep</i>” (v. 20).  In other words, Jesus was first in this process of being resurrected and changed to have a glorified body unto life
				eternal. The entire point of the passage is that there <i><b>is</b></i> a resurrection of the body.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does the Watchtower have any other "proof verses" they use to confirm their contention
				that Jesus is now a spirit being with no corporeal body?  Walter Martin (<i>Kingdom</i>, p. 97) shares that they often refer to <b>I Peter
				3:18</b> which reads in part "<i>... being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit</i>". They interpret this to mean that
				his flesh was done away with (to them “death” means the cessation of existence) and that all that is left is his spirit.  But the very
				words of the verse defeat them.  It says that he was raised "<i><b>by the Spirit</b></i>" or, in other words, by the power of God; <b>not</b>
				that he was raised "<i><b>as a spirit</b></i>".  Obviously there is a big difference in those two little words.  It doesn’t say what the
				Watchtower would try to make it say.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other big argument JW’s make is that in some instances Jesus was either not
				recognized as himself (<b>Mark 16:12; John 20:14-16</b>) or that he did things which a person with a fleshly body cannot do (<b>Luke 24:31
				John 20:26</b>).  They take these phenomena to mean that he has an existence which is not consistent with a fleshly body.  In their book
				<i>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</i> (p. 144) they say:
				<blockquote>
					<i>That same day Jesus appeared to many disciples ... Usually they could not at first tell it was Jesus, for he appeared in different
					bodies. He appeared and disappeared just as angels had done, because he was resurrected as a spirit creature.  Only because Thomas
					would not believe did Jesus appear in a body like that in which he had died.</i>
				</blockquote>
				However their arguments are not consistent with the Bible.  With regard to Mary’s failure to recognize him near the tomb, this can be
				easily attributed to her distraught state of mind and the fact that she was not expecting to see him alive again.  The passage in <b>Mark
				16</b> regarding the two disciples has a parallel in <b>Luke 24:13-31</b> which gives much greater detail and clearly states twice that
				the reason they did not recognize Jesus was that he affected their eyes so that they could not (<b>vv. 16, 31</b>).  That might also be
				the case with Mary though we are not clearly told so.  Neither do his sudden vanishing and appearing comprise evidence that he does not
				have a real body.  As we have already seen, his body, though corporeal (real), is a new glorified body (<b>I Cor. 15:35-54</b>) like that
				which we will receive.  <b>Verse 44</b> describes it as a body "<i>raised in power</i>" which implies that these new bodies will have many
				more capabilities than the ones we now possess.  However, we do not even have to go there to refute their argument that the things Jesus
				did after his resurrection "prove" that he is a spirit.  He also did those kinds of things before his death and resurrection.  <b>Matthew
				14, Mark 6</b> and <b>John 6</b> all record the well known story of Jesus walking on the Sea of Galilee while <b>Luke 4:28-30</b> also
				relates an interesting occurrence where Jesus apparently miraculously avoided a crowd of people who wanted to kill him.  Are we to suppose
				that because such things as these cannot be done by a natural, fleshly body that Jesus did not have one at that point either?  JW’s will
				not suggest that.  Their "proof" has no power.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, what do we see in scripture that leads us to believe that Jesus did
				have a real body which was, in fact, the one he always had which was raised and changed? The passages in <b>Luke 24:36-43</b> and
				<b>John 20:19-20, 24-29</b> are compelling. JW’s would have us believe that Jesus deceived the disciples to trick them into believing that
				he was really raised from the dead by appearing as a man when he was in fact a spirit.  His clear denial of being a "<i>spirit</i>" in
				<b>Luke 24:39</b> is in reality a lie?  But that’s what the Watchtower teaches and so that’s what the JW’s believe.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These teachings tie in with their view of  Christ’s return.  We saw in the review of
				their history that Charles Russell incorrectly predicted that the world system would end in 1914 and Jesus would return to set up his
				kingdom.  When that did not happen the Watchtower eventually changed their teaching to say that the kingdom of God was set up fully in
				heaven and that Jesus returned to earth invisibly.  Again Walter Martin quotes <i>Let God Be True:</i>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Christ Jesus returns, not again as a human, but as a glorious spirit person</i> (p. 196); <i>Some wrongfully expect a literal
					fulfillment of the symbolic statements of the Bible.  Such hope to see the glorified Jesus seated on a white cloud where every human
					eye will see him. ... Since no earthly men have ever seen the Father ... neither will they see the glorified Son</i> (p. 186); <i>It
					does not mean that he [Christ] is on the way or has promised to come, but that he has already arrived and is here</i> (p. 198).
					(<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 55.)
				</blockquote>
				In From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained they confirm:
				<blockquote>
					<i>So in 1914, unseen to human eyes, Christ’s second "coming" into the kingdom took place.</i>
				</blockquote>
				Since Jesus is an invisible spirit creature, as they affirm, it makes sense (to them) that he would return invisibly.  What has he been
				doing all this time?  Directing the Watchtower Society and ruling through them, of course! (David Reed, <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered
				Verse by Verse</i>, p. 53.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do they try to use Scripture to support their view?  Yes.  Mostly by changing the word
				"<i>coming</i>" to "<i>presence</i>" in <b>Matthew 24:3, 26-28</b>.  Also by some bad and fanciful interpretations of the apocalyptic
				portions of Scripture (cf. <i>Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</i>, pp. 169-185).  A specific verse they like to use is <b>John 14:19</b>.
				But that is obviously speaking of Jesus’ ascension where the world in general will not see him physically anymore.  Later they will be
				judged and cast out of his presence for all time.  But believers will see him at his resurrection appearances and later in a spiritual
				sense through the indwelling of the Spirit (<b>vv. 15-18</b>).  <b>Verse 19</b> does not mean that nobody in the world will ever see him
				again.  They also like to say that since <b>Acts 1:9</b> says that he was received "<i>out of their sight</i>" into heaven and <b>v. 11</b>
				says he "<i>will so come in like manner</i>" that he will return invisibly.  This is obviously deceptive.  Because, of course, they could
				see him until he went into the cloud.  He will also come back through the clouds to where he can be seen again on the Mount of Olives.
				That this is true is evidenced from other passages which, of course, are ignored or twisted by the JW’s.  God’s word clearly declares that
				the return of Jesus will be manifest to all.  We see it in:  <b>Zechariah 12:10; 14:4; Matthew 24:29-30</b>; and <b>Revelation 1:7</b>.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why is all this important?  Because again it relates to the concept of biblical truth in
				general and, more specifically, to the person of Christ -- who he is and what he promises to do.  It is vital that we accept him at his
				word.  If we cannot believe him in these details, why believe in Jesus at all?  And there is the exact problem with the Jehovah’s Witnesses.
				They do not believe what God’s word says about Jesus nor any other subject unless it conforms to their own preconceived ideas about what
				makes sense and what is acceptable in their own minds.  Anything else they deny and doing that is foolish and dangerous.  God’s word is
				absolute and reveals the only One worthy of trusting our lives to -- Jesus Christ, our Lord and God and our Savior.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Theology and Teachings (with Rebuttal): The Consciousness of the Soul after Death and the Doctrine of Hell</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already seen by their own statements that Jehovah’s Witnesses do not believe that the
				soul continues to consciously exist after a person dies.  That position necessarily makes the idea of hell obsolete.  After all, if a person does
				not exist then he cannot be punished.  Hence we should consider these two doctrines together since they are connected so strongly.  We will
				consider what reasons the JW’s give and what Scripture passages they try to use to support their views with regard to these beliefs.  And, of
				course, we will offer a refutation of their arguments and consider what the Bible really does say to the person who "<i>has ears to hear</i>".
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem begins with narrow and incorrect definitions of key words.  Let’s begin with the
				Hebrew word for "<i>soul</i>" which is "<i>nephesh</i>".  JW’s say that this word refers exclusively to a living being.  To bolster their
				contention they point to <b>Genesis 2:7</b>.  Therefore, to them, a person is a unified being consisting of a "<i>combination of physical
				material and 'breath', which together form a living soul</i>" (Ron Rhodes, <i>The Ten Most Important Things You Can Say to a Jehovah’s
				Witness</i>, p. 99.)  This combination is inseparable.  When a person dies then, all aspects of his being perish.  There is nothing after a
				person’s death unless God chooses to recreate that person at a later date.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which brings us to their definition of the word "<i>death</i>". As we have previously
				observed, to JW’s death means to stop existing, period.  Walter Martin cites the Watchtower publication <i>Make Sure of All Things</i>
				(p. 86) which gives the following meanings for death:
				<blockquote>
					<i>... loss of life; termination of existence; utter cessation of conscious intellectual or physical activity, celestial, human, or
					otherwise</i> (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 121).
				</blockquote>
				Ron Rhodes quotes <i>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</i> (p. 88) as saying,
				<blockquote>
					<i>When a person is dead he is completely out of existence.  He is not conscious of anything</i> (<i>The Ten Most Important Things You
					Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witness</i>, p. 100).
				</blockquote>
				Since death is the end, there can obviously be no eternal punishment for those not "raised" (recreated) to enter into either heaven or
				paradise on earth.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But since the Bible does speak of a place called hell, it must be dealt with in some
				fashion.  The JW’s again simply take the words used in the Bible for "hell" and define them very narrowly so as to not conflict with their
				theology.  Both the Hebrew word "<i>Sheol</i>" and the Greek word "<i>Hades</i>" are said to only mean "<i>the grave</i>".  Also in <i>Let
				God Be True</i> (p. 96) JW’s assert that
				<blockquote>
					In all places where hell is translated from the Greek word Gehenna it means everlasting destruction”  (Martin, Kingdom, p. 102).
				</blockquote>
				Thus in some cases where the Bible refers to hell, JW’s say that it is merely speaking of a person dying and being buried.  In other places
				where it may refer to fire or torments, JW’s would say that it is a reference to the annihilation of the wicked.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>**  Rebuttal:</b>  In a brief response to these matters, the main issue is the JW
				contention that a word can have but one meaning.  Walter Martin quotes the 1946 edition of <i>Let God Be True</i> (pp. 69-70) which states:
				<blockquote>
					<i>If you were to translate a book from a foreign language into English and there you found the foreign word for bread 65 times, would
					you translate it 31 times bread, 31 times fish, and three times meat?  Of course not.  Why? Because if you did your translation would
					not be correct.  For what is bread cannot at the same time be fish or meat and vice versa.  The same holds true with the word Sheol.
					If Sheol is the grave, it is impossible at the same time to be a place of fiery torture and at the same time a pit</i>  (<i>Kingdom</i>,
					p. 101).
				</blockquote>
				It sounds logical, doesn’t it?  But it is another example of poor scholarship and misunderstanding.  The truth is that many words have more
				than one meaning and the true meaning is determined by the context in which it is used.  Ron Rhodes gives the example of the word
				"<i>trunk</i>" which can possibly refer to an elephant’s nose, the large, central woody part of a tree, the back of a car or a large piece
				of luggage (<i>The Ten Most Important Things...</i>, p.101).  We usually have no trouble figuring out which is meant based on what we are
				talking about at the time.  The same is true of all these words.  (Ironically, Martin shares that the example used in <i>Let God Be True</i>
				regarding "bread", "fish" and "meat" is a reality in the Hebrew scriptures
				<blockquote>
					<i>where the word lechem is translated 'bread' 238 times, one time as 'feast', 21 times as 'food', one time as 'fruit', five times as
					'loaf', 18 times as 'meat', one time as 'provision', twice as 'victuals', and once as 'eat'.</i>
				</blockquote>
				He also shares that in the 1951 edition of the same volume, the above "<i>paragraph was carefully omitted</i>" <i>Kingdom</i>, p. 101).
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To be specific, yes, <i>nephesh</i> can mean a <i>living being</i> as in <b>Genesis
				2:7</b> and <b>Ezekiel 18:4</b>, but it can also refer to the seat of the emotions (or the inner person) as in <b>II Kings 4:27</b> or
				that part of man which is immaterial as in <b>Genesis 35:18</b>. (Rhodes, p. 102).  In the KJV <i>Sheol</i> is translated 31 times as
				<i>grave</i>, 31 times as <i>hell</i> and three times as <i>the pit</i>.  The general concept of people in Old Testament times was of a
				shadowy underworld where the dead waited for God’s judgment.  They did not have the revelation of the New Testament about what life after
				death was like.  But they nevertheless did not believe the grave was the end, as JW’s would assert.  The  word <i>Hades</i> is much like
				<i>Sheol</i> and in fact is used in the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures) in every instance except one to translate
				it from Hebrew to Greek.  It is only used ten times in the New Testament with the most well known instance probably being <b>Luke 16</b>
				where Jesus told the story of the rich man and Lazarus which certainly does not teach an unconscious non-existence after death.  The Greek
				word <i>Gehenna</i> is derived from the Hebrew term for the Valley of Hinnom which was near Jerusalem.  This place is referred to and known
				for various things but probably most famously for the human sacrifices to Molech during the reigns of Ahaz and Manasseh.  Later the use
				changed to burning refuse and the bodies of criminals.  Thus people came to think of it as a place of fire, smoke, rot, worms and death.
				Eventually it became associated with the place of final judgment on the wicked and Jesus used that thought as He taught His disciples and
				the people about the possibility and terrible nature of hell (i.e. Sermon on the Mount in <b>Matt. 5:22, 29-30</b>).  Rather than utter
				destruction, it is a picture of eternal misery.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The JW concept of death is just flat-out wrong.  Death is always represented in the Bible
				as <i>separation</i> <i><b>not</b></i> <i>extinction</i>.  As Herbert Kern (<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 51) and many
				others attest, physical death is the separation of the body and the spirit while spiritual death is the separation of a person and God.
				Furthermore, death separates people from each other in the sense that the living no longer interact with those who are physically dead.
				But this does not necessarily mean that the physically dead no longer exist anymore than it means that a living person who is away from
				our presence ceases to exist.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Returning to the JW point of view, what are some of the passages they use to seek to
				establish their doctrines with an unwary listener?  Beginning with their idea that there is no conscious soul or spirit remaining after
				the death of a person we will point out that they often use <b>Psalm 146:3,4</b> and <b>Ecclesiastes 9:5-6, 10</b>.  They cite both
				passages to argue that a person thinks no more after he dies.  In the New World Translation (also KJV & NASV) <b>Psalm 146:4</b> is
				translated in part "<i>... in that day his <b>thoughts</b> do perish</i>".  However the more correct reading is that "<i>his <b>plans</b>
				perish</i>” (NKJV, NIV & RSV).  Regardless of the exact word used the main idea is that when a person dies his plans, dreams and ambitions
				do not matter anymore and simply vanish away.  With regard to Ecclesiastes, the entire context of the book is set in <b>1:2-3</b>.  Solomon
				is discussing all these things in connection to how they relate to the earthly existence "under the sun".  Therefore with regard to the
				things happening on earth, it is true that the dead know nothing -- they are not here anymore.  JW’s may also refer to <b>Ezekiel 18:4</b>
				to point out that the "<i>soul</i>" dies.  The real issue here is not that a "<i>soul</i>" (here "<i>nephesh</i>” does refer to a living
				being or a person) may die -- we accept that.  The real issue is what they mean by "<i>death</i>" -- which we do not accept.  JW’s may
				also appeal to various passages that speak of death as "<i>sleep</i>".  Here they would argue that death is unconsciousness just like
				real, physical sleep is for living people.  The problem (for them) is that this term is never used in connection with the soul or spirit.
				As Martin says,
				<blockquote>
					The term ‘sleep’ is always applied to the body, since in death the body takes on the appearance of one who is asleep, but the term
					‘soul sleep’ or ‘the sleep of the soul’ is never found in Scripture and nowhere does it state that the soul ever sleeps or passes
					into a state of unconsciousness. (Kingdom of the Cults, p. 121.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for the denial of a real hell and everlasting punishment, they do not refer to any
				specific passages but are reduced, as we have seen, to denying the doctrine by redefining the words used to depict it.  Further they
				attribute such a teaching to the deceiving schemes of Satan (though why Satan would want to convince people of a literal hell, I have no
				idea).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what does the Bible have to say?  There are so many clear statements and events in
				God’s word to refute these erroneous beliefs that we will not be able to refer to all of them.  Let’s begin again with the notion that
				there is no conscious existence of the soul after death.  We have already seen <b>Genesis 35:18</b> which tells us that as Rachel was
				dying her soul departed or separated from her body which confirms the biblical view of death and defeats the JW idea.  In <b>I Samuel
				28:11-15a</b> we see that God allowed the spirit of Samuel to briefly return to speak the word of the Lord to  King Saul.  To speak as
				Samuel did (<b>vv. 16-19</b>) one must be conscious.  The same is true of the following passages:  <b>Luke 9:28-31; 16:19-31; Revelation
				6:9-11</b>.  In all of these acknowledged dead people are speaking and interacting with others.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Note:</b> To deal with <b>Luke 16:19-31</b>, JW’s dismiss to it as a parable in which
				Lazarus symbolizes the true disciples of Christ and the rich man represents false religious leaders.  Their deaths point to the change of
				conditions on earth which Jesus’ coming made and so forth and so on.  The objective of the Watchtower is to not let it relate to what
				really happens after death.  Christians are divided on the question of whether this passage is a "<i>parable</i>".  Walter Martin says it
				is not since it is never referred to as such nor interpreted (as many parables were) and because Jesus never used personal names in His
				other teachings which are seen as parables (<i>Kingdom</i>, p. 105).  David Reed suggests that it is but points out that since all of
				Jesus’ stories and parables were based on real life situations, there is no reason why this passage can not reflect the reality of
				conscious existence after death even if the story itself is fictional (<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered...</i>, pp. 63-64).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To continue, notice the following passages which all make essentially the same point but
			in different ways: <b>Matthew 26:24; Luke 12:4-5; 23:43; II Corinthians 5:6-8; Philippians 1:21-23</b>.  What is the point?  In each passage
			a future condition -- either a promise for a better one or a warning about a worse one -- is being described as applying to a person
			immediately <i>after</i> death.  We might ask questions like:
			<blockquote>
				<i>If not being born is non-existence and dying is also non-existence, how is it Jesus says it would have been <b>better</b> for Judas not to have
				been born?</i>
			</blockquote>
			Or:
			<blockquote>
				<i>Why should a person fear someone who can do more than kill the body if after the body is killed there is nothing left to throw into
				hell</i> (lit. Gehenna)?
			</blockquote>
			Or:
			<blockquote>
				<i>If death means non-existence then why does Paul continually teach that he expected to be with Christ at his death and thus have a better
				experience than he has now in the body (life)?</i>
			</blockquote>
			Such questions will be difficult for the JW to answer.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Note:</b>  Regarding Jesus’ promise to the thief in <b>Luke 23:43</b>, please be aware
				that JW’s deal with this by moving the comma from before "<i>today</i>" to after it in the NWT causing the verse to read: "<i>...Assuredly,
				I say to you today, you will be with me in Paradise</i>".  In essence they change it to mean Jesus was speaking "<i>today</i>" to the thief
				but the promise was open-ended as to when it would be kept.  Both David Reed (<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered...</i>, pp. 68-69) and Ron
				Rhodes (<i>The Ten Most Important Things...</i>, pp. 106-07) point out that in every instance of Jesus using the words "<i>Assuredly I say
				to you</i>" as an introductory phrase  (six in Luke and 74 in all four gospels) the NWT places a comma after the "<i>you</i>" and before
				the subsequent statement <b>except</b> this one.  Why?  Because this one damages their preconceived ideas about life after death (or rather
				the lack thereof).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now let us turn to what the Bible says about the existence of a literal hell.  Since the
				two doctrines we are considering are intertwined, we have already seen some passages which could be used here.  But there are plenty of
				others to support the teaching.  Jesus often spoke of hell as a place of "<i>darkness</i>" where people would constantly be "<i>weeping and
				gnashing ... teeth</i>”  (<b>Matthew 8:12; 13:42, 50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luke 13:27-28</b>).  In <b>Mark 9:42-48</b> Jesus gives a graphic
				description of hell (probably drawn from the Valley of Hinnom as we discussed earlier) which was intended to show how terrible it will be to
				go there since the punishment goes on and on.  He even teaches that the sacrifice of a sinful body part to avoid hell should not be considered
				too much of a price to pay.  It is worth any sacrifice to not go there.  Peter and Jude also describe hell as a place of "<i>darkness</i>"
				which will be last "<i>forever</i>" (<b>II Peter 2:17; Jude 13</b>).  That this punishment is eternal cannot be disputed since in
				<b>Matthew 25:46</b> the words describing both <i>punishment</i> and <i>life</i> as <i>everlasting</i> and <i>eternal</i> are the same in
				Greek (<i>aionion</i>).  In the book of Revelation we see the final judgments of God and the doctrine of an eternal hell is very prominent.
				In <b>14:9-11</b> a warning is given that those who take the mark of the beast will be consigned there.  In <b>19:20</b> we see the beast
				and false prophet are cast into the lake of fire.  In <b>20:10</b> Satan himself is finally cast in after being bound for one thousand
				years.  Notice that the beast and false prophet (whom most think will be human beings) are still there suffering.  Annihilation at some
				point would be a blessing as opposed to hopelessly unbearable and unending pain.  But that is not what the Bible teaches.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though they may attempt to deny this truth, it is plain to see -- there is no getting
				away from it.  The Lord has clearly warned mankind about the consequences of sin and unbelief.  An infinite debt to an infinite God
				requires infinite payment and we as humans are only infinite in one way, namely, the span of our existence.  God’s justice will not let
				Him obliterate a person for the debt must be paid one way or another.  In God’s mercy and love He sent the Son Jesus Christ to pay our
				debt so that we might avoid eternal damnation.  He is the only way.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that we have examined the major doctrinal errors of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, let us
				turn our attention to the underlying source of those errors.  We are speaking, of course, of the elite leaders who, through their
				publications, determine how the general membership thinks and acts.  Those publications are released under the name <i>Watchtower Bible and
				Tract Society</i>.  The Society, and Jehovah’s Witnesses in general, claim that they alone have Gods’ truth and that God only works through
				their organization.  If this is so, then it follows that their sources of authority had better be accurate and reliable.  We will consider
				two aspects of Watchtower influence upon its members:  <i>The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</i> and various prophecies made
				by the leadership over the years.</font></p>

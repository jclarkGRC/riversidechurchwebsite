			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Theology and Teachings (with Rebuttal): The Deity of Jesus Christ</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second major doctrinal disagreement between the Jehovah’s Witnesses and Christianity
				is closely related to the first one we examined, namely that of the Trinity.  Obviously, when you deny the Trinity you are also stating that
				at least one of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit is not Jehovah God.  We have already seen that the JW’s reject the notion that either Jesus
				the Son or the Holy Spirit are co-equal to God the Father.  Now we want to spend some time focusing on the specific issue of the deity of
				Jesus Christ.  It has been said that "<i>all cults break down on the Person of Jesus Christ</i>".  As Christians, we are supposed to be
				followers and disciples of Christ.  While we accept the complete truth of the whole Bible about all that it teaches, our only hope for
				salvation is in Jesus Himself.  It is He who makes our salvation possible through what He did in His earthly life, death and resurrection.
				Because He became the sacrifice that would satisfy the Father’s wrath regarding sin we can have His righteousness applied to us by
				<i>believing</i> in Him (<b>John 3:15-18; Acts 16:31; Romans 10:9-10</b>).  It pleases the Father to justify those who place their trust in
				Jesus Christ -- this is grace extended by God through the agency of faith.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore it is of supreme importance that we have a correct belief.  Now that does not
				mean that it is necessary to know all the theological answers about the nature of God and so on.  A small child can be saved without knowing
				these things and so can an adult for that matter.  But we must believe in Jesus for who He truly is and as He declared Himself
				(<b>John 8:21-24</b>).  Without being human He could not stand in for us and take our place on the cross.  And without being God Himself He
				could not pay the infinite price that would satisfy the infinite wrath of an infinite God.  Without being both at once Jesus was not qualified
				to achieve our salvation (cf. Rhodes, <i>The Ten Most Important Things You Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 51).  Furthermore, Jesus
				taught these things about Himself and if we deny what He claims for Himself, how can we say that we believe in Him?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet that is exactly what JW’s do.  They deny that Jesus is Jehovah God.  They try to smooth
				it over by applying other good attributes and titles to Him but they will not accept that He is God incarnate.  They put forth several
				arguments to defend and contend for this position.  Let’s see what they have to say and examine it against the teachings of the Bible.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It may be helpful to first get an overall view of exactly what JW’s do believe about Jesus
				and then examine each part as needed.  According to the Watchtower tract <i>What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?</i> (1987, p. 3) and their
				pamphlet <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i> (1989, p. 14) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that Jesus was a created being.  Specifically he
				was originally Michael the Archangel (Though I do not possess JW material that teaches this, three of my previously cited sources,
				<i>Cult Watch</i>, <i>The 10 Most Important Things You Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witness</i> and <i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>
				all assert this and cite the following Watchtower publications for support:  <i>Aid to Bible Understanding</i>, 1971, p. 1152; <i>You May
				Survive Armageddon into God’s New World</i>, 1955, p. 112; <i>Is This All the Life There Is?</i>, 1974, p. 128.) who was the very first
				thing Jehovah created and whom God then used as His "<i>junior partner</i>" (<i>Should You Believe</i>...?, p. 14) to create all other
				things. Later at the appropriate time God "<i>transferred the life-force</i>" of Michael (who ceased to exist) to Mary’s womb who
				subsequently gave birth to Jesus.  Thus this is not an incarnation of Jehovah God, but the creation of a "<i>perfect</i>" human being.
				JW’s accept, for the most part, the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ life and death (though they claim that he really died on a stake and that
				the cross is a pagan religious symbol promoted by Satan -- cf. pictures in <i>The Watchtower</i>, June 15, 2004, p.17 and <i>Should You
				Believe ... ?</i>, p. 18).  However, they again diverge greatly from orthodox Christian belief about what happened after his death and
				about the results of his death.  First, they say that Jesus the man died and therefore ceased to exist (remember that to them <i>death</i>
				means <i>to stop being</i>).  Charles Russell wrote, "<i>The man Jesus is dead, forever dead.</i>" (<i>The Atonement Between God and Man</i>,
				p. 454 quoted by <i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 68.). Jehovah then <i>raised</i> him (which to them really means <i>recreated</i> him) as a
				<i>spirit</i> creature (no bodily resurrection).   In <i>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</i> on p. 143 as quoted by Ron Rhodes
				(<i>The 10 Most Important ... </i>, p. 42) it says:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Having given up his flesh for the life of the world, Christ could never take it again and become a man once more.</i>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The clincher is that he became a new, improved and now immortal Michael the Archangel.
				That was his reward for his service on earth.  The information now becomes a little contradictory.  John Ankerberg and John Weldon in
				<i>Cult Watch</i> (pp. 68-69) say that JW’s believe that
				<blockquote>
					since Jesus (Michael) is now "<i>a spirit creature (an angel), it is impossible that He could ever return to earth visibly and
					physically."  Therefore, they teach that Michael returned invisibly in 1914.</i>
				</blockquote>
				(Remember the failed prophecy of Christ’s return we saw in the historical section.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, Ron Rhodes in <i>The Ten Most Important Things</i> (p. 42) quotes
			<i>Aid to Bible Understanding</i> (p. 1395) to point out that JW’s teach that Jesus (Michael) proved His "resurrection" to the disciples in
				that "<i>He appeared ... on different occasions in various fleshly bodies, just as angels appeared to men of ancient times.  Like those
				angels, he had the power to construct and to disintegrate those fleshly bodies at will, for the purpose of proving visibly that he had
				been resurrected.</i>"  Which is it? Can he appear visibly or not?  (This might be a tough question for them to answer if the conversation
				ever swung this way.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what’s the point of all this?  JW’s believe that the death of Christ was not to pay
				for the sins of the whole race.  Rather it was only to pay for the sin of the only other (temporarily) perfect human being who ever lived,
				namely, Adam.  The death of the second paid for the sin of the first.  Herbert Kern puts it this way:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Christ’s death cleared the slate so that Jehovah’s Witnesses could earn the rest of the points needed to try to prove themselves
					worthy of everlasting life.</i> (<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 11).
				</blockquote>
				In their estimation, for God Himself to have died as a sacrifice on the cross would have been way too much ransom for what justice
				actually required.  Therefore Jesus was just a man, perhaps perfect, but still created, inferior and subordinate to Jehovah
				God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that we have completed an overview of what the JW’s believe about Jesus Christ we
				need to consider how they justify these beliefs.  To fundamental Christians the Bible is so clear on the divine nature of Jesus.  How can
				this group contend that Jesus was not God?  Even more disturbing, how are they able to convince people who have attended Christian churches
				(and thus should know better) that this is so?  The short and simple answer is that they misinterpret, take out of context and twist the
				Scriptures in an attempt to make it fit their view.  For those not grounded in the Word what they say can sound good and make sense.
				Remember that in their arguments they appeal heavily to the use of <i>human reason</i>. They emphasize that if a doctrine doesn’t make
				sense or we can’t understand it then we need to automatically reject it.  Let’s take a look at the verses they most commonly use to try
				to deny the deity of Jesus Christ.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>John 1:1</b></i></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jehovah’s Witnesses make much of this verse in their conversations with people who
				affirm that Jesus is God.  They assert that the verse should read this way:  "<i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
				and the Word was <b>a god</b>.</i>”  Why?  Here is a good example of how JW’s try to use pseudo-scholarship to impress and intimidate
				Christians who are not well informed about the grammar of the Greek language and how it is constructed.  In Koine Greek there is no
				indefinite article (like our English "<i>a</i>" or "<i>an</i>") but there is a definite article ("<i>the</i>").  So when a writer in
				Greek wants to designate something specifically, he would insert a definite article (though we may not always see that reflected in
				English).  If a noun does not have a definite article it may be indefinite, or, in other words, a general reference rather than a specific
				one.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the original language of <b>John 1:1</b> the first reference to God has a definite
				article ("<i>ton theon</i>").  Therefore we know that it is a specific and definite reference to the one true God and thus it is
				capitalized and rendered "<i>with <b>God</b></i>".  However the second reference does not have a definite article preceding it
				("<i>theos</i>").  This is where JW’s start grasping at straws.  Because there is no definite article they claim that it should not be
				considered a specific reference to the one true God but rather an indefinite article should be supplied and it should be translated
				"<i>a god</i>".  To the average person this sounds right, but it is not.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greek scholars agree that certain constructions, which I will not detail here (for more
				information see Walter Martin’s <i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, pp. 85-87;  Josh McDowell and Don Stewarts’s <i>Handbook of Today’s
				Religions</i>, pp. 59-60;  Ron Rhodes’ <i>The Ten Most Important Things You Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witness</i>, pp. 28-30) do not require
				that a noun without a definite article be translated with an indefinite article.  In other words "<i>theos</i>" by itself can legitimately
				be translated as the one true "<i>God</i>" in the proper circumstances.  In the case of <b>John 1:1</b>, this approach is required.  Walter
				Martin says to do otherwise is "<i>incorrect grammar and poor Greek</i>" (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 85).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To further bolster their claim, JW’s may point to various other translations of the Bible
				which agree with their New World Translation (cf. <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i>, p. 27).  These are always obscure translations
				from liberal scholars who probably reject the doctrine of the Trinity also.  Never will you find listed a well known and widely accepted
				translation.  In fact Ron Rhodes quotes Julius Mantey, co-author of <i>A Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament</i>, as saying with
				regard to <b>John 1:1</b> that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Ninety-nine percent of the scholars in the world who know Greek and who have helped translate the Bible are in disagreement with
					the Jehovah’s Witnesses.</i>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But here is the clincher.  In the same chapter the JW’s ignore their own rule about the
				absence of the definite article completely.  In vv. <b>6, 12, 13, 18 of John chapter one</b> we see repeatedly forms of the word
				"<i>theos</i>" without the definite article and yet the New World Translation renders them (correctly) as <b>God</b>.  The question is why
				do they only adhere to their rule in verse one?  The clear answer is that they wish to deny the deity of Christ.  (Martin gives several more
				instances in other Bible passages where JW’s translate "<i>theos</i>" without a definite article as "<i>God</i>".) <b>Point to make with
				your JW acquaintance:</b>  In <b>Isaiah 43:10-12</b> (where they get their name) we are told that there is no other God but one and apart
				from Him is no "<i>savior</i>".  Ask him if Jesus Christ is Jehovah God.  He will say no.  But if you ask him if Jesus is a god, based on
				their version of <b>John 1:1</b>, he will readily agree.  If you ask him if Jesus is a savior, he should also agree to that.  Return to
				what <b>Isaiah 43:10</b> says and emphasize that there can only be one true God.  He may try to get around that by saying that the Hebrew
				word "<i>elohim</i>" is used to refer to angels (<b>Psalm 8:5</b>),  men who are judges (<b>Psalm 8:1-6</b>) and the New Testament refers
				to Satan as a god (<b>II Cor. 4:4</b>).  He may also say that Jesus is a "<i>mighty god</i>" but not the Almighty God.  Emphasize that we
				know the difference between angels, men,  mighty ones and the one true God.  You can refer to <b>Isaiah 10:21</b> and <b>Jeremiah 32:18</b>
				where the Lord is called the "Mighty God".  Point out that in <b>I Corinthians 8:4-5</b> we are told that though there are many other
				"<i>gods and lords</i>", they are false.  Ask him again if Jesus is Jehovah God.  He will not agree.  Ask if Jesus is then a false god.
				He will not agree to that either.  You must press him that if Jesus is not Jehovah then He must certainly be a false god or else the
				Jehovah’s Witnesses are polytheists.  They have no answer to this dilemma except for the strained idea of different levels of godhood
				("<i>mighty</i>" vs. "<i>Almighty</i>") which is ludicrous.  Either there is one God or there is not.  The point of this is to cause
				him to consider the contradiction and inadequacy of not accepting Jesus as Jehovah God and yet trying to insert Him into their belief
				system as a mere man. (Credit to Robert L. Sumner, <i>Biblical Evangelism in Action</i>, p. 188;  McDowell and Stewart, <i>Handbook of
				Today’s Religions</i>, p. 60; and Walter Martin, <i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, pp. 84-85 for this line of reasoning and appropriate
				verses.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>John 20:17; I Corinthians 8:6</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jehovah’s Witnesses use these verses (along with others such as <b>Matthew 3:16-17;
				Mark 15:34;</b> and <b>Luke 23:46</b>) to try to make the point that God the Father is distinct from Jesus Christ.  The overall idea is
				similar to that of the denial of the Trinity.  They are saying since Jesus is making references to the Father as his God or praying to
				God or the Father is speaking about Jesus and so on, they must therefore be separate entities and thus cannot be the same Jehovah God.
				It is an argument based on man’s perception of reality and what seems reasonable about the nature of God.  Perhaps an analogy will help
				here.  An amoeba is a single celled animal and it is separate from everything else.  If such a creature had the capacity to think and
				reason and came into contact with a human who is made of trillions of cells, do you think it might have a hard time comprehending how all
				these different cells can still be one person?  Yet that is the truth.  We are made of many cells yet we are one being -- something beyond
				the capacity of an amoeba to grasp if it could reason thus.  Just so God is beyond our capacity to understand.  How can One Being also be
				three separate Personalities?  Yet that is the way God is revealed in the Bible.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With respect to <b>John 20:17</b> we must remember that Jesus is speaking as a man to a
				woman and through her sending a message to other men.  The thrust of the message is that He will soon be returning to Heaven to be reunited
				with God the Father. Why does He phrase His words this way?  Jack Stallings (<b>The Gospel of John</b>, p. 280) asserts that Jesus’
				references to "<i>My Father</i>" and "<i>your Father</i>" and "<i>My God</i>" and "<i>your God</i>" tells us two things.  First, because
				of Christ’s work we as believers can now call God "<i>Father</i>".  We are adopted into the family and are joint heirs with Jesus (cf.
				<i>Romans 8:15-17</i>).  He is still Almighty God whom we revere and worship but now we are in a new relationship with Him.  But more to
				the point for this study, Jesus uses the "<i>My</i>" and "<i>your</i>" to make a difference between our relationship with the God the
				Father and His relationship with God the Father.  His Sonship is on a different plane than ours.  He is the unique, one and only Son of
				God, who is of the same nature as God and equal with God.  Far from indicating that the Father and the Son cannot be the same God, this
				verse shows the difference between us as regular mortal men and Jesus Christ the man who is also God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another verse commonly used by JW’s to deny that Jesus is God is <b>I Corinthians 8:6</b>.
				Their logic is that it clearly says that there is "<i>one God, the Father</i>" and "<i>one Lord, Jesus Christ</i>".  Thus they claim that
				the Bible clearly shows that the only God is the Father not Jesus Christ.  Jesus is "<i>Lord</i>" but He is not "<i>God</i>".    This can
				be disconcerting to an unprepared Christian.  However, Hebert Kern (<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 27) and David Reed
				(<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>, pp. 95-96) provide help.  Basically JW’s will want to stop after making the point
				that Jesus is not God.  But you must not let them.  If by their logic this verse is true in one direction, it must also be true in reverse.
				In other words, if Jesus is not God because there is only one, namely the Father, then it is equally true that the Father is not Lord
				because there is only one, namely Jesus Christ.  They will not want to admit this because they constantly refer to Jehovah as "Lord".
				But they cannot have it both ways.  The fact is that the Bible uses the terms "<i>God</i>" and "<i>Lord</i>" almost interchangeably.
				The Father is referred to as both "Lord" and "God" and so is the Son Jesus Christ.  It is even so with reference to false gods in this
				same passage (<b>v. 5</b>).  JW’s are trying to make a distinction here that simply does not exist especially when you examine the
				functions in the verse ("<i>Of whom are all things</i>" and "<i>through whom are all things</i>" both speak of the power of the one true
				God).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>John 14:28</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This verse (along with <b>John 10:29</b>) is a favorite for JW’s to use to "prove" that
				Jesus is not Jehovah God.  They especially emphasize the phrase "<i>for my Father is greater than I</i>" (in <b>10:29</b> "<i>My Father ...
				is greater than all.</i>") and take it to mean that since the Father is greater than Jesus then Jesus must be a lesser god (same reasoning
				applies to phrase from <b>10:29</b>).  This is hard to answer for many Christians who have been taught (correctly) that Jesus the Son is
				equal to God the Father.  It does seem to say that Jesus is inferior to the Father.  What’s the answer? The answer is that the Father was
				superior to Jesus just as the Bible says <i>but only in His position not in His nature</i>.  <b>Philippians 2:5-8</b> tells us that Jesus
				humbled Himself and accepted the form and position of a man which was inferior to that of God the Father.  In fact, <b>Hebrews 2:9</b> tells
				us this human form was also inferior to the angels.  The Father occupied the place of highest honor and majesty in Heaven while on earth
				Jesus the man was despised, rejected and eventually nailed to a cross.  But this does not mean that the divine nature of Jesus was negated.
				Jesus was God incarnate (God in the flesh).  A quick example to explain this might be that many of us can truthfully say that another person
				is "greater" than we are in any number of <i>quantitative</i> (measurable) ways -- intelligence, skills, achievements and so on.  But that
				does not mean that we are different in our essential natures.  We are still both human beings and thus entitled to the same rights and
				privileges under the law.  Just so it was true that God the Father had a greater position without being different in nature from Jesus the
				Son.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Walter Martin (Kingdom of the Cults, pp. 118-119) makes the point that if Jesus had meant
				to say that the Father was <i>qualitatively</i> greater, then the Greek word "<i>kreisson</i>" would have been used which is translated in
				<b>Hebrews 1:4</b> as "<i>better</i>" (rather than "<i>meizon</i>" translated "<i>greater</i>").  In the context Jesus is said to be
				"<i>better than the angels</i>}.  This is speaking of the contrast between His essential nature and their essential nature.  Jesus is
				different and better than they in His quality.  He is Creator and they are creations.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>I Corinthians 11:3</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This verse is also greatly used by JW’s to argue that Jesus cannot be God because Jesus
				was subservient to the Father and how can God be under the authority of anyone?  (Some other verses JW’s use like this are:  <b>Matthew
				20:23; Luke 22:42; Mark 13:32;</b> and <b>John 5:19; 6:38; 7:16; 10:18</b>.)  This is a similar position to the passage we just examined
				and so the answer is also much the same.  When Jesus humbly took on the form of a man He also voluntarily submitted Himself to the authority
				of the Father and limited Himself with regard to His divine attributes.  This was necessary for Him to fully assume the role of a
				man.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With regard to <b>I Corinthians 11:3</b>, in which they emphasize "<i>the head of Christ
			is God</i>", it is easy to dismiss their logic.  The verse also says that "<i>the head of woman is man</i>".  But again we know that men and
			women are <i>essentially</i> the same -- male and female of the same race.  There may be differences between us <i>functionally</i> but not in
			our natures, in other words, we are all people.  Just so, the Son is willingly <i>functionally</i> subordinate to the Father without diminishing
			His deity.  They are equal in being who they are -- the one true God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>John 1:14,18; 3:16,18</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jehovah’s Witnesses like to use these verses (along with <b>I John 4:9</b>) to deny that
				Christ is Jehovah God by taking the words "<i>only begotten</i>" to mean "<i>only generated</i>".  In other words, Jesus the Son had his
				origin through an action of the Father.  This means that Jesus is not eternal God Almighty but instead is "<i>junior</i>" to the Father
				because he is a creature -- perhaps the first and greatest of them all -- but still only a creature  (cf. <i>Should You Believe in the
				Trinity?</i>, pp. 15-16).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Greek word for "<i>only begotten</i>" is "<i>monogenes</i>".  Walter Martin says that
				"<i>the most authoritative lexicons and grammar books, not to mention numerous scholarly works, all render "monogenes" as "only or unique
				‘the only member of a kin or kind, hence generally only.’</i>" (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 114-115.)  Thus Christians take "<i>only
				begotten</i>" to refer to the uniqueness of Jesus as the one and only, one-of-a-kind Son of God.  Jack Stallings writes that it "<i>is a
				compound of the noun meaning ‘kind’ or ‘genus’ (Greek genos) rather than the verb ‘born’ (Greek gennao).  It therefore literally means ‘of
				a single kind’ rather than ‘only begotten.’</i> ”  (<i>Randall House Bible Commentary on John</i>, p. 24.)  Here we see the JW’s first
				mistake in saying that "<i>monogenes</i>" comes from "<i>ginomai</i>" which means "<i>to generate</i>".  Stallings quotes Raymond Brown who
				says "<i>Although genos is distantly related to gennan, ‘to beget,’ there is little Greek justification for the translation of monogenes
				as ‘only begotten.’</i>"  The NIV recognizes these truths in their translation of "<i>monogenes</i>" with "<i>one and only</i>".  Jesus is
				God’s Son in a way that nobody else is God’s Son.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jehovah’s Witnesses try to get around this by referring to <b>Hebrews 11:17</b> where the
				same Greek word is translated "<i>only begotten</i>" but this time in relation to Abraham and Isaac.  They assert that since Abraham was
				obviously Isaac’s father as we know and understand that relationship in human terms -- Abraham preceded Isaac and Abraham procreated Isaac
				-- that it must also apply to Jesus and His Father.  Thus, they say, God the Father preceded the Son and by His actions created him.  It
				certainly sounds logical.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, JW’s have an enormous problem in trying to make this point stick.  They
				completely forget or ignore that <i>Isaac was not Abraham’s only son</i>.  In <b>Genesis 16</b> we see that years before Isaac, Abraham had
				another son by Hagar named Ishmael.  Later in <b>Genesis 25</b>, after Sarah’s death, he remarried and had six more children.  Since they
				accepted the definition for "<i>monogenes</i>" as "<i>only born, only begotten, i.e. an only child</i>" and also "<i>of sole descent, i.e.,
				without brothers or sisters</i>,” this clearly cannot be the meaning of "<i>monogenes</i>" in <b>Hebrews 11:17</b>.  In other words what
				might be considered the naturalistic application of the word is out.  How then can "<i>monogenes</i>" be applied to the relationship of
				Abraham and Isaac?  Simply, it is applied the same way that it is used of Jesus in the verses we have seen already.  Isaac was the son of
				promise.  He is not the only son nor even the eldest son, but he was the special son through whom God would fulfill His promises to Abraham.
				In this sense, He was unique and precious to his father Abraham in a way that none of the other children would ever be.  This was
				demonstrated in how Abraham sent away first Ishmael (<b>ch. 21</b>) and later all the other children and gave all that he had to Isaac as
				an inheritance (<b>Gen. 25:5-6</b>).  So we see that this word is used very consistently in the Bible even when it is speaking of natural
				human relationships.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One more thing which may help us understand this a little more clearly.  It is not
				incorrect to say that Jesus as the Son of man was begotten by God (<b>Luke 1:35</b>).   Clearly, he had to be born of a woman to be a
				real man.  This was a process that happened at a point in time so it did have a beginning.  What is incorrect is to say the Jesus Christ
				as Jehovah God, second Person of the Triune Godhead had a beginning -- that the Person never existed before the birth of the man Jesus or
				that He was preceded by and created by the first Person of the Trinity.  Before His incarnation He was the eternal <i>Logos</i> or Word of
				God (<b>John 1:1</b>).  The terms Father and Son are functional terms which are to be understood as relating to their relationship in time
				and in the eternal future, not in eternity past.  Walter Martin writes,
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Scripture nowhere calls Jesus Christ the eternal Son of God ... (also) the term ‘Father’ incidentally never carries the
					descriptive adjective ‘eternal’ in Scripture.</i> (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 117.)
				</blockquote>
				In other words, the terms "<i>Father</i>" and "<i>Son</i>" designating two of the Persons of the Trinity become
				relevant only after the incarnation of Christ.  This is important to realize because Jehovah’s Witnesses try to make the term "<i>Son</i>"
				denote the quality of being created and inherent inferiority.  The idea of sonship here, on the other hand, denotes that He is "<i>of the
				(same) order of</i>" His Heavenly Father (cf. Ron Rhodes, <i>The Ten Most Important Things You Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witness</i>, p. 46.)
				Admittedly, the incarnation (God in the flesh) is difficult to grasp.  How can one Person be one hundred percent God and at the same time
				one hundred percent man?  Yet we rely on the fact that this is how Jesus Christ is revealed to be by His word, the Bible.  We must not
				deny this truth based on what makes sense according to human perspective combined with the misapplication of a common word.  Sadly, that
				is exactly what the JW’s try to do.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Colossians 1:15;  Revelation 3:14</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will consider these two verses together for as Walter Martin says in reference to
			<b>Colossians 1:15</b>,
				<blockquote>
					<i>The Watchtower teaches that since Christ is called the “firstborn of all creation,” therefore He must be the first one created, and they
					crossreference this with Revelation 3:14 which states that the faithful and true witness (Christ) is “the beginning of the creation of
					God.</i>  (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 123; cf. <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i>, p. 14.)
				</blockquote>
				Jehovah’s Witnesses use both verses in essentially the same way, that is, to try to  that the Jehovah preceded Jesus in existence and
				created Him.  This would mean that Jesus had a beginning at some point and is therefore not of the same nature as Jehovah.  Again, because
				of the English words in the verses and how we commonly use them, the conclusions reached by the JW’s seem sound ... until you look a little
				deeper.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us consider <i>Colossians 1:15</i> first.  Josh McDowell and Don Stewart write that,
				<blockquote>
					<i>The meaning of “firstborn” in <b>Colossians 1:15</b> is perhaps impossible, or at least difficult to understand without an accurate
					understanding of its Old Testament implications.</i>  (<i>Handbook of Today’s Religions</i>, p. 50.)
				</blockquote>
				In the Old Testament "<i>firstborn</i>" does sometimes simply refer to the first child or first creature born to its parents (i.e.,
				<b>Gen. 41:51-52; Ex. 13:11-12</b>).  But there is another obvious meaning of the word that we can see in other passages such as
				<b>Jeremiah 31:9</b> and <b>Psalm 89:20, 27</b>.  In those passages God is speaking of Ephraim and David.  But the literal and simple
				meaning of "<i>firstborn</i>" cannot apply because:
				<ol>
					<li>
						We know that Ephraim was Joseph’s second son and David was Jesse’s youngest son.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the context of <b>Jeremiah 31</b>, Ephraim is actually a reference to the nation of Israel so it’s hard to see how a literal
						rendering of firstborn can apply.
					</li>
					<li>
						Since the speaker in both cases is God we know that this man, David, and this nation, Israel, were not literally His firstborn
						children.
					</li>
				</ol>
				Then how can it apply?  The word also sometimes means first in rank, position or privilege.  This meaning came to be because of the favor
				given to a firstborn son who received the special blessing, a double share of the inheritance and authority to become head of the family
				(i.e., Jacob and Esau’s struggles over the family birthright and blessing in <b>Genesis 25-27</b>).  So one who is favored and placed in
				the prominent position can be said to be the "<i>firstborn</i>" even if it is not literally true.  David came to be preeminent as king and
				thus is referred to as "<i>firstborn</i>".  Though there were many nations which existed before Israel, this people became God’s chosen
				people and so are called His "<i>firstborn</i>:.  So the question becomes:
				<blockquote>
					<i>How is Paul using the term “firstborn” in <b>Colossians 1:15</b>?  Literally as being the first creature created?  Or figuratively
					denoting His rank, position and authority?</i>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The answer must be and is found in the context (cf. <b>Colossians 1:15-18</b>).  When you
				see:
				<ol>
					<li>
						that Jesus created all things;
					</li>
					<li>
						that He was before all things;
					</li>
					<li>
						that He sustains all things;
					</li>
					<li>
						that "<i>firstborn from the dead</i>" cannot be taken literally (it is paradoxical -- the dead are not born) nor can it even be
						taken in a time reference (people were raised from the dead before Jesus -- <b>I Kings 17:17-22; II Kings 4:32-35; Matt. 9:18-25;
						Luke 7:11-15; John 11:43-44</b>) so it must mean that Jesus is preeminent over it -- all the others died again, Jesus conquered
						death;
					</li>
					<li>
						that the last phrase of the passage spells out clearly what Paul is trying to show these Colossians (whose big problem and a main
						reason for this epistle, by the way, is that they have an inadequate view of Jesus), namely, that Christ is the preeminent One in
						all ways;
					</li>
				</ol>
				then it becomes pretty clear how he is using "<i>firstborn</i>" here.  He is pointing to the primary position of Jesus Christ above all
				things.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This passage as a whole is a problem for the JW’s.  As Walter Martin says that since
				<blockquote>
					" <i>... He is the Creator of all 'things', which to any rational person indicates that if He is Creator of all things, He Himself is
					not one of the 'things' created!</i>" (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 123.)
				</blockquote>
				So how do they deal with it?  By inserting the word "<i>other</i>" between "<i>all</i>" and "<i>things</i>" four times in verses
				<b>16-17</b> in the New World Translation.  This gives the impression that Jesus was just another of all the things that were created.
				Suffice it to say that there is absolutely no justification for this in the Greek text.  In fact, there does not even exist a word for
				"<i>other</i>" in the Greek language so it cannot be in the text.  JW’s claim that the context implies it just as in <b>Luke 13:2,4</b>.
				But there you know that "<i>Galileans</i>" are being compared with  "<i>Galileans</i>" who are the of the same nature and likewise
				"<i>sinners</i>" with "<i>men</i>".  In that case "<i>other</i>" is certainly implied.  The only way this word is implied in
				<b>Colossians</b> is if you have a predetermined bias that Jesus is a created being or thing and so can be compared to these things.
				JW’s add to the text to bolster their own position instead of letting it speak for itself.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, Ron Rhodes and others point out that if Paul wanted to convey what JW’s teach
				that Jesus was Himself created by the Father, then he would have used a different word (<i>The Ten Most Important Things You Can Say to a
				Jehovah’s Witness</i>, p. 48).  The Greek word in the passage is "<i>prototokos</i>".  But another word "<i>protoktisis</i>" actually
				means "<i>first created</i>".  Why not just use the word that makes the point clear if you are trying to communicate that Jesus was the
				first being Jehovah created?  The obvious answer is that Paul (under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit) used the correct word that
				communicated the accurate truth about Jesus, namely, that He is not a created being, instead He is the preeminent One above all things
				because He created all things.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Turning to <b>Revelation 3:14</b>, we see that JW’s try to use one of the words of this
				verse in much the same way as "<i>firstborn</i>".  We noted in their literature they give the impression that the Greek word "<i>arche</i>"
				is almost always translated and thus usually means "<i>beginning</i>".  (<i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i>, p. 14.)  It can
				indeed mean "<i>beginning</i>" or "<i>original</i>".  If this is the best translation here, the phrase can be viewed two ways
				grammatically according to McDowell and Stewart.  It can be seen passively, as the JW’s do, to mean that Christ was the first or
				original creature made by Jehovah.  Or it can be seen actively to mean that Christ was the originator of God’s creation.  In other words,
				He is not the first one created but instead He is the active source or author of creation.  (<i>Handbook of Today’s Religions</i>, p.
				47.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we should also understand that "<i>arche</i>" has other valid meanings as well.
				Both Herbert Kern (<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 28) and David Reed (<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>, p
				. 104) note that "<i>arche</i>" can also mean "<i>ruler</i>" (Kern also lists "<i>first in rank</i>" and "<i>first cause</i>" -- which
				fits well with the idea that Jesus is the original source of creation -- while Reed mentions "<i>magistrate</i>" and "<i>power</i>").
				The 1978 edition of the <i>Analytical Greek Lexicon Revised</i> by Harold Moulton has all these meanings and more.  Kern and Reed also
				note that the NIV actually translates  <b>Revelation 3:14</b> so that it reads "<i>the ruler of God’s creation</i>".  We see "<i>arche</i>"
				used this way in Bible passages such as <b>I Thessalonians 4:16</b> which has the compound word "<i>archangel</i>" which we take to mean
				that such an angel is a chief or head with authority over other angels.  The word is also used that way in some of our English words like
				"<i>archbishop</i>" and "<i>architect</i>".  The point is that the JW implication that this word must always mean "<i>beginning</i>" is
				not true.  Even if it were true, one does not have to read it as they do.  In short, there is no basis in this verse for their claim that
				Jesus is the first created being.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Is Jesus really Michael the Archangel?</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To wrap up this portion concerning how Jehovah’s Witnesses justify their claims about
				Jesus we need to address one more matter.  They claim that originally he was Michael the Archangel and that after his death, God recreated
				him again as Michael.  Though this is not popularly taught in their meetings it is their official position declared by many of their
				publications as noted earlier.  It may well be that this particular issue will never arise in a conversation with a JW, but it nonetheless
				needs to be answered.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Orthodox, fundamental Christianity has never taught, believed or accepted that Jesus was
				at one time Michael or any other angel, for that matter.  But more importantly the teachings of Bible contradict such a belief.  Credit to
				both Herbert Kerns (<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, pp. 15-16) and Ron Rhodes (<i>The Ten Most Important Things You Can Say
				to a Jehovah’s Witness</i>, pp. 43-44) for the following points:
				<ol>
					<li>
						In <b>Daniel 10:13</b> Michael is referred to by the messenger sent to Daniel as "<i>one of the chief princes</i>".  This infers
						that there are at least a few more like him.  However we have already seen that by the use of the word "<i>monogenes</i>" to
						describe Jesus, the Scriptures proclaim Jesus to be unique.  He is not "<i>one of</i>" anything!  He is in a class by Himself.
					</li>
					<li>
						In <b>Jude 9</b> we see that Michael would not take it upon himself to rebuke the devil because he apparently did not have the
						authority to do so.  Jesus, on the other hand, did not hesitate at all to rebuke Satan (<b>Matt. 4:10; 16:23</b>).  How then can
						they be the same?
					<li>
						The writer of Hebrews makes it exceedingly clear that Jesus is superior to the angels in all ways.  They are never called God’s
						Son in the special way that Jesus is (<b>1:5</b>).  Angels are required to worship Jesus (<b>1:6</b>).  No angel will ever be g
						iven dominion over the world to come (<b>2:5</b>) while Jesus is repeatedly referred to as the One who will reign forever in the
						Scriptures (<b>Isaiah 9:6; Luke 1:31-33; Rev. 19:16</b>).
					</li>
					<li>
						Jehovah’s Witnesses try to use <b>I Thessalonians 4:16</b> to claim that because "<i>the Lord Himself</i>" is coming "<i>with the
						voice of an archangel</i>" it means that Jesus is an archangel.  Using that line of reasoning it must be equally true that since He
						is also coming "<i>with the trumpet of God</i>" it shows that He is God.  Of course, they reject that.
					</li>
				</ol>
				It may be best to see these elements as separate things.  Jesus Himself will shout -- perhaps as a summons or command to the dead to
				come forth as with Lazarus in <b>John 11:43</b> (Robert Picirilli, <i>Randall House Bible Commentary on I Thessalonians</i>, p. 71), an
				archangel (perhaps Michael but maybe another) will also use his voice to proclaim victory, and finally the trumpet of God will sound
				(<b>I Cor. 15:52</b>).  Whether they happen all at the same time or in rapid succession is a matter of speculation.  The point is that the
				verse does not prove that Jesus is an archangel.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Further Refutation of Jehovah’s Witness View of Jesus</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that we have analyzed and rebutted the Jehovah’s Witness interpretation of  the
				texts they use to deny the deity of Christ, let us take a more positive angle by examining what the Bible does say about Jesus’ identity.
				These passages clearly establish that Jesus is beyond a doubt Jehovah God <i>and also that Jesus Himself claimed this to be true</i>.
				That is important because JW’s maintain that Jesus never said He was God but rather His words were misconstrued by His followers (<i>Should
				You Believe in the Trinity?</i>, p. 16).  Therefore, we will focus on passages from the Gospel of John since it was written for the reason
				that people might believe in Jesus as very God (<b>John 21:30-31</b>) and also in it Jesus makes statements for Himself.  We will also
				discuss how JW’s try to deal with these passages.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>John 5:18</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This verse is quite plain.  It contradicts what JW’s say, which is, that since Jesus is
				referred to as the Son and called God in heaven "<i>My Father</i>", therefore He must be secondary in existence and in position to Jehovah.
				This verse clearly establishes that when Jesus called God "<i>Father</i>" He was actually claiming equality with God, or in other words,
				claiming that He Himself is Jehovah God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What do JW’s say about this?  They say that <i>Jesus</i> was not saying this about Himself
				but that John was recording what the <i>Jews</i> were saying about Jesus (cf. <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i>, p. 24).  Their
				assertion is that the Jews were either mistaken about what Jesus meant or were making false charges for an excuse to kill Him.  This is
				obviously not true as Walter Martin notes,
				<blockquote>
					<i>... nor is it contextually or grammatically allowable that John is here recording what the Jews said about Jesus, as Jehovah’s
					Witnesses lamely argue</i> (<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 96).
				</blockquote>
				It was John under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit who makes the statement.  He is simply revealing what the Jewish mind would make of
				Jesus’ claim of God as His Father.  They took it the way He meant it -- as a proclamation of His full Deity.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>John 8:58</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The context of this verse is a running debate between Jesus and the Jews about exactly
				who Jesus is claiming to be (<b>v. 53</b>).  At the end the Jews scoff at Jesus who has claimed to exist prior to Abraham (<b>v. 57</b>)
				to which Jesus makes a withering reply and answers once for all the question of who he really is in <b>v. 58</b>.  When Jesus says "I AM"
				it is in reference to the occasion where God is giving Moses an answer to the anticipated question that the Hebrews would ask Moses, which
				was, "<i>Who sent you?</i>"  God told Moses what he should reply in <b>Exodus 3:14</b> which was,
				<blockquote>
					Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, "I AM has sent me to you."
				</blockquote>
				Jesus now in response to the Jews is claiming to be the One who is called "I AM", or in other words, to be the same Jehovah God who
				commissioned Moses, who called Abraham out of Ur, and who did all the other recorded feats of the Old Testament.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That this was what Jesus said and that this is what He meant can be readily seen from
				the reaction of the Jews.  They immediately begin to pick up rocks in order to stone Him to death.  Everyone around knew what Jesus meant
				when He referred to Himself as "<i>I AM</i>".  Those who did not believe it reacted logically (though not correctly) by attempting to
				stone Him for claiming to be God which in their view was blasphemy.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do the JW’s respond to this passage?  In two ways mainly.  First, with regard to the
				attempted stoning, Walter Martin notes that they sometimes say that the Jews were upset that Jesus had earlier called them "<i>children of
				the devil</i>" in <b>v. 44</b> (To which we might ask: ‘Then why didn’t they pick up stones in v. 48 instead of simply returning a
				perceived insult?’).  In <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i> they assert that
				<blockquote>
					this time the Jews wanted to stone Jesus for claiming to ‘have seen Abraham’ although, as they said, he was not yet 50 years old (p. 26).
				</blockquote>
				 We need to understand that such a violent response was not a light thing for the Jews.  Martin shares that there are only five legitimate
				 reasons from the Law of Moses to stone a person.  He states,
				 <blockquote>
				 	<i>Those cases were:
					<ol>
					 	<li>
					 		Familiar spirits, <b>Leviticus 20:27</b>;
						</li>
						<li>
							Cursing (blasphemy), <b>Leviticus 24:10-23</b>;
						</li>
						<li>
							False prophets who lead to idolatry, <b>Deuteronomy 13:5-10</b>;
						</li>
						<li>
							Stubborn son, <b>Deuteronomy 21:18-21</b>; and
						</li>
						<li>
							Adultery and rape, <b>Deuteronomy 22:21-24</b> and <b>Leviticus 20:10</b>.
						</li>
					 </ol>
					 Now any honest Biblical student must admit that the only legal ground the Jews had for stoning Christ (and actually they had none at
					 all) was the second violation -- namely, blasphemy (Kingdom of the Cults, pp. 87-88).</i>
				</blockquote>
				He also notes that because these Jews were legalists they would not want to do anything which might later result in themselves being called
				to account for their actions.  Furthermore in a separate confrontation in <b>10:33</b>, the Jews explain exactly why they think they have
				a right to stone Him.  It is the same as here -- their wrong notion that Jesus’ claim to be God was blasphemy.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, their primary answer is to change the wording of the verse.  They state on p. 26
				of <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i> that
				<blockquote>
					<i>The expression at <b>John 8:58</b> is quite different from the one used at <b>Exodus 3:14</b></i>.
				</blockquote>
				They again list several marginal translations of the Bible which render the verse in ways acceptable to them, finally concluding with
				their own New World Translation which reads: "<i>... before Abraham came into existence, <b>I have been</b></i>" (emphasis mine).  Both M
				artin (<i>Kingdom</i>, p. 88) and McDowell and Stewart (<i>Handbook of Today’s Religions</i>, p. 61) note that JW’s try to justify this
				with a footnote in the NWT text claiming that the Greek words "<i>ego eimi</i>" should be "<i>properly rendered in the ‘perfect indefinite
				tense.’ </i>"  However, what that means is anybody’s guess because, as both the cited volumes attest, there is no such thing as the
				"<i>perfect indefinite tense</i>".  Martin says the term was "<i>invented by the authors of the note</i>" and McDowell/Stewart mention
				that they later changed it (out of embarrassment, no doubt) to read "<i>the perfect tense</i>" which, by the way, is still incorrect
				because "<i>ego eimi</i>" is in the present tense, indicative mood.  The point of their changing the wording is an effort to acknowledge
				that Jesus did exist before Abraham (as Michael the created angel) without associating Him with the "<i>I AM</i>" of<b> Exodus
				3:14</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Their contention that "<i>the expression in <b>John 8:58</b> is quite different from ...
				<b>Exodus 3:14</b></i>" is also wrong.  The Septuagint (a translation of the Hebrew scriptures, what we call the Old Testament, into Greek
				and widely used in the time of Christ) uses these exact same Greek words "<i>ego eimi</i>" to translate the Hebrew word "<i>ehyeh</i>"
				which means "<i>I am</i>".  David Reed, who was once a dedicated Jehovah’s Witness himself, reveals that even the Watchtower admits this
				fact in their 1984 large-print <i>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures with References</i> which has a footnote on <b>Exodus 3:14</b>
				which says the Hebrew would be rendered in Greek as "<i>ego eimi</i>"  (<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>, p. 27). What
				Greek words do you suppose John under inspiration uses to express what Jesus actually spoke there in <b>8:58</b>?  Of course, the same
				ones -- "<i>ego eimi</i>".  And once again Reed notes that their own 1985 <i>Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures</i>
				shows this fact.  The only difference is that one passage is originally in Hebrew and the other in Greek.  But that Jesus used words that
				communicated His claim to Deity is not in question.  Martin says that concerning its use in the Old Testament:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The phrase occurs only where Jehovah’s Lordship is reiterated</i> (<i>Kingdom</i>, p. 88).
				</blockquote>
				A.T. Robertson writes that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Undoubtedly here Jesus claims eternal existence with the <b>absolute phrase used of God</b></i> (<i>Word Pictures in the New
					Testament</i>, pp. 158-59, emphasis mine).
				</blockquote>
				This passage is therefore a powerful testimony to the fact that Jesus Christ is Jehovah God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>John 17:5</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This verse is another which clearly testifies to what Jesus believed with regard to His
				own identity.  In the words of Jesus’ prayer we see that He claimed to exist "<i>before the world was</i>" which testifies to His eternal
				existence (though this part of the verse, as we have seen, is not in itself a problem for JW’s as they would simply say this is a reference
				to His existence as Michael the first created angel and junior partner of Jehovah).  But the other major part of the verse, which concerns
				"<i>the glory which I had with you</i>" that Jesus desires to be restored to Him in its fullness now that He had "<i>finished the work</i>"
				(<b>v. 4</b>), is a problem for them. Why?  Because, as Walter Martin points out (<i>Kingdom</i>, p. 93), when you cross reference this
				verse with <b>Isaiah 42:8</b> and <b>48:11</b> where Jehovah Himself is speaking and declares that He will not share His glory with nor
				give it to anyone else, it becomes unmistakably clear that for Jesus to participate in this glory then He must be Jehovah.  This is not
				speaking of an earthly glory or the glory that Jesus had by being recognized as the Messiah by His disciples.  It is the glory which is
				inherent in the fact that He is in His nature Almighty God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are questions that might arise from JW’s, or anyone else for that matter, upon
				hearing this.  Why would Jesus need to have this glory restored if He is God?  The answer is that He voluntarily laid this glory aside
				when He came to earth and took on the form of a servant and came in the likeness of a man (<b>Philippians 2:6</b>).  Now that His mission
				is over He will be glorified by the Father and will return to His station as King of kings and Lord of lords (<b>Philippians 2:9-11</b>).
				Or another question might be that if Jesus never ceased to be Jehovah God, where was His glory when He walked the earth?  Though this is
				partially answered in the first response, we can elaborate by saying that Jesus certainly could have revealed His glory explicitly at any t
				ime.  We see this is so in <b>Mark 9:2-3</b> where Jesus is transfigured before Peter, James and John.  But He chose to mostly conceal His
				glory and demonstrated it mainly through signs and miracles that only the power of God could accomplish.  Why did He do that?  For one
				thing His glorified state would have frightened people to death (<b>Mark 9:5-6; Rev. 1:17</b>).  But perhaps more importantly, God wants
				people to respond to Him in faith, not having seen the full revelation.  When we can see a thing for ourselves, it is no longer faith and
				that is what God desires in us and will eventually reward (<b>II Cor. 5:7; Heb. 11:1-3, 6</b>).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only way JW’s argue against this verse, according to Martin (<i>Kingdom</i>, p. 94)
				is by claiming that in the phrase "<i>which I had with you</i>" the word "<i>with</i>" should be translated "<i>through</i>" instead.
				Thus they say, the glory is only from the Father and is reflected by Jesus the Son, as the moon reflects the light of the sun, for example.
				However, this is another case of poor or deceptive scholarship.  The Greek word in this verse for "<i>with</i>" is "<i>para</i>".  It does
				have flexibility as a preposition but it never means "<i>through</i>".  If John (or actually the Holy Spirit) wanted to communicate the
				idea as presented by the JW’s, then why didn’t he simply use the Greek word "<i>dia</i>" which is the obvious choice for "<i>through</i>".
				The answer is, of course, that the idea  that Jesus participated in the glory because He is Himself Jehovah is correct as it stands
				affirmed by this verse.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>John 20:28</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Walter Martin states that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>No treatment of the Deity of Christ would be complete without mentioning the greatest single testimony recorded in the Scriptures</i>
					(<i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 95).
				</blockquote>
				I wholeheartedly agree with that assessment.  In the context, Thomas, the lone skeptic among the disciples because he was not there when
				Jesus had appeared, at last comes face to face with Jesus.  Overcome and speaking directly to Jesus, Thomas simply proclaims, "<i>My Lord
				and my God</i>".  A significant point is that the word "<i>God</i>" is preceded by a definite article which means they cannot resort to
				translating it as "<i>a god</i>" as they try to do in <b>John 1:1</b>.   A literal word for word rendering of the phrase would go: "<i>The
				Lord of me and the God of me</i>."  David Reed points out that their own 1985 <i>Kingdom Interlinear Bible</i> confirms that translation.
				So here is an undeniable example of a reference to "<i>the God</i>" or Jehovah being applied to Jesus Christ  though they still try to
				slip that thought in if possible (cf. <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i>, pp. 28-29).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another point is that if it is true that Jesus never claimed to be God as JW’s allege,
				then here would be the perfect time to rebuke Thomas for his mistake.  Herbert Kern points out that Peter (<b>Acts 10:25-26</b>), Paul and
				Barnabas (<b>Acts 14:11-18</b>), and the angels (<b>Rev. 19:10; 22:8-9</b>) were always exceedingly careful and quick to reject the worship
				of others (<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 24).  Surely if Jesus were not God and knew it, He would do the same.  So what
				was His response to Thomas?  In <b>v. 29</b> we see it -- a slight chiding of Thomas for taking so long, but acceptance and approval of his
				conclusion and a promise of blessing to those who would believe in the future that He is Lord and God without seeing firsthand.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do JW’s respond to this?  Reed mentions that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>the less knowledgeable JW may try to brush it off by saying, ‘Thomas was just exclaiming his surprise.  If we saw a friend return from
					the dead, we, too, might say, ‘Oh! My God!’ out of sheer surprise.  Thomas didn’t mean anything by it</i>  (<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered
					Verse by Verse</i>, p. 84; also cf. <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i>, p. 29).
				</blockquote>
				In other words, Thomas took the name of the Lord God in vain even though he was a Jew raised to obey the Ten Commandments.  This is obviously
				ridiculous, but let’s assume that Thomas slipped and did that -- are we then to imagine that Jesus would not at least rebuke him for such
				blatant blasphemy?  The other more sophisticated approach that both Reed and <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i> mention is that JW’s
				may refer to <b>20:17</b> where Jesus refers to the Father as "<i>My God</i>" and also to <b>20:31</b> where Jesus is called "<i>the Son of
				God</i>" both of which are taken by them to mean that Jesus is inferior to the Father.  We have already dealt with these verses or the ideas
				behind them.  Suffice it to say that these verses point to Jesus’ unique relationship with the Father and identify Him as being of the same
				order or nature.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will conclude this section on the Deity of Jesus Christ by saying that contrary to what
				Jehovah’s Witnesses say Jesus definitely made the claim for Himself to be Jehovah God and the New Testament testifies to the fact that it
				is so.  There are, of course many more passages which corroborate these facts.  For further study I would recommend Walter Martin’s treatment
				in <i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, pp. 83-97.  Also Herbert Kern does a good job laying out an extensive case  in <i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s
				Witnesses</i>, pp. 15-26.  As we mentioned at the very beginning of this section, having the right view of Jesus is vital to salvation.  Not
				because I say so but because of Jesus’ words recorded in <b>John 8:24</b>.  That phrase "<i>I am He</i>" comes from the same Greek words
				"<i>ego eimi</i>" that are translated "<i>I AM</i>" in <b>8:58</b>.  In other words Jesus is saying that they will die in their sins if
				they do not accept that He is Jehovah God who has come in the flesh.  This is not optional theology.  It is life and death.  That is why
				we have spent so much time on this matter.  It is critical to understand and accept Jesus for who He is -- King of kings and Lord of lords,
				the one true Almighty God who gave Himself to redeem us from our sin.  That is what the Bible teaches and that is what we must believe to
				have salvation.</font></p>

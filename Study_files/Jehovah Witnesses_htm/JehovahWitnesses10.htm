			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Unreliability of the Watchtower Society -- The New World Translation</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was first published in 1950 (New Testament only) and eventually completed by 1960 in
				six volumes and revised in 1961 into a single volume.  It has been revised a few more times since then.  But from the beginning, the
				Watchtower Society has proclaimed to be superior to other translations, mainly because the men working on it were free from the bias
				of conventional Christianity.  Walter Martin shares a quote from their 1950 <i>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</i>
				where speaking of other translations they say:
				<blockquote>
					<i>But honesty compels us to remark  that, while each of them has its points of merit, they have fallen victim to the power of human
					traditionalism in varying degrees.  Consequently, religious traditions, hoary with age, have been taken for granted and gone
					unchallenged and uninvestigated.  These have been interwoven into the translations to color the thought.  In support of a preferred
					religious view, an inconsistency and unreasonableness have been insinuated into the teachings of the inspired writings ... The
					endeavor of the New World Bible Translation Committee has been to avoid this snare of religious traditionalism</i> (<i>Kingdom of the
					Cults</i>, p. 72).
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, they make it quite clear that they believe their translation to be quite
				accurate and adequate for instruction about God.  In their 1984 edition, the Foreword states:
				<blockquote>
					<i>The translators of this work, who fear and love the Divine Author of the Holy Scriptures, feel toward Him a special responsibility to
					transmit his thoughts and declarations as accurately as possible.  They also feel a responsibility toward the searching readers who
					depend upon a translation of the inspired Word of the Most High God for their everlasting salvation</i> (p. 5).
				</blockquote>
				In the Introduction they claim to give
				<blockquote>
					<i>as literal a translation as possible where the modern-English idiom allows ... It is realized that even such a seemingly insignificant
					matter as the use or omission of a comma or of a definite or indefinite article may at times alter the correct sense of the original
					passage</i> (p. 7).
				</blockquote>
				(<b>Note:</b>  I must say that, in light of what we have already seen, the irony of these statements is beyond belief.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If, as they believe, the Watchtower is the sole source of God’s revelation to man it is
				crucial that these claims of accuracy be true.  But are they?  What can be said of them with regard to the faithfulness of the translation
				from the original languages to English?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, let’s consider the opinions of several leading scholars in this field.  Ron Rhodes
				(<i>The Ten Most Important Things You Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witness</i>, pp. 24-25) and John Ankerberg and John Weldon (<i>Cult Watch</i>,
				pp. 73-74) share quotations from such men:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Dr. Julius Mantey who co-authored <i>A Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament</i> said,
						<blockquote>
							<i>I have never read any New Testament so badly translated as <b>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures</b>.
							In fact, it is not their translation at all.  Rather, it is a distortion of the New Testament.  The translators used what J.B.
							Rotherham had translated in 1893, in modern speech, and changed the readings in scores of passages to state what Jehovah’s
							Witnesses believe and teach.  That is distortion, not translation.</i>
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Dr. Bruce M. Metzger, the late professor  of New Testament at Princeton University called the NWT
						<blockquote>
							<i>a frightful mistranslation</i>" and also used words like "erroneous", "pernicious", and "reprehensible" in describing
							it</i>.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						Dr. William Barclay declared that
						<blockquote>
							<i>the deliberate distortion of truth by this sect is seen in their New Testament translation ... It is abundantly clear that a
							sect which can translate the New Testament like that is intellectually dishonest.</i>
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						Dr. Robert Countess who, in a dissertation on the NWT for his Ph.D. in the Greek language, wrote that it
						<blockquote>
							<i>has been sharply unsuccessful in keeping doctrinal considerations from influencing the actual translation ... It must be
							viewed as a radically biased piece of work.  At some points it is actually dishonest.  At others it is neither modern nor
							scholarly.  And interwoven throughout its fabric is inconsistent application of its own principles enunciated in the
							Foreword and Appendix.</i>
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						Dr. H.H. Rowley, a British scholar comments that
						<blockquote>
							<i>From beginning to end this volume is a shining example of how the Bible should not be translated ... an insult to the word
							of God.</i>
						</blockquote>
					</li>
				</ol>
				Ankerberg and Weldon further comment that even non-Christian scholars agree that the NWT is poorly done based on the common Greek rules
				of grammar, word meanings and so on (<i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 74).  So the criticism being leveled here is not only from Christians who
				affirm the Trinity, deity of Christ, etc., it is also from those who have no stake in defending the historical doctrines of Christianity.
				It is a bad translation from the viewpoint of the experts.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which raises another question which we have previously broached briefly.  What of the
				translators who worked on the NWT?  What of their credentials as experts?  It is interesting to note that for years the Watchtower refused
				to divulge the identity of the members of the committee who worked on the NWT.  Their reason was that the contributors desired that God
				should receive the glory for this translation instead of themselves.  Very noble, indeed, but that coincidentally also prevents anyone
				from examining these men’s qualifications.  It wasn’t until 1983 when Raymond Franz, a close relation of then Watchtower Society President
				Frederick Franz and highly placed in the organization, after leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses, wrote his book <i>Crisis of Conscience</i>
				that the names of these "translators" were revealed.  Rhodes names five -- Nathan Knorr, Frederick Franz, Albert Schroeder, George Gangas
				and Milton Henschel (<i>The Ten Most Important Things...</i>, p. 25).  After this revelation it became apparent why their identities were
				hidden.  Four of them had only high school educations with no exposure to biblical languages at all.  Frederick Franz claimed to know
				Hebrew and Greek however it was later shown that he had dropped out of University of Cincinnati after his sophomore year.  Whether or not
				he had classes in Greek is in dispute but years later on the stand in a court of law in Scotland he failed to be able to translate
				<b>Genesis 2:4</b> which is considered a very simple passage in Hebrew (Martin, <i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 73).  In any case, it is
				evident that none of these men were linguistic experts in any sense of the word.  That being the case, a rational person should think twice
				before committing his future to a reliance on the doctrines taught in this twisted translation.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the course of this study we  have seen for ourselves how the Watchtower blatantly
				changes the words and punctuation of key passages so as to reinforce their own erroneous beliefs (i.e., <b>John 1:1</b> "<i>the Word was a
				god</i>"; <b>John 8:58</b> "<i>Before Abraham came into existence, I have been</i>."; <b>Colossians 1:16-17</b> where they put
				"<i>[other]</i>" before "<i>things</i>" to imply that Jesus was one of the "<i>things</i>" created by Jehovah; <b>Luke 23:43</b> where
				they place the comma after "<i>today</i>" instead of before to deny the promise that the thief would consciously be with Jesus that very
				day after they died).  We will not revisit all the reasons why these changes are wrong.  Neither at this point will we take a lot of time
				to lay out more technical cases about other problems in other passages (though there are several more just as bad).  But I do want to
				share three quick items that point to how unreliable the NWT is because it is manipulated to conform to the prevailing views of the
				Watchtower.  The first has to do with the JW idea that Jesus was not crucified on a cross as is almost universally accepted by Christendom.
				They claim that this is a pagan religious symbol adopted by the church when Satan gained control of the Roman Catholic leadership.  In place
				of the word "<i>cross</i>", they put "<i>torture stake</i>" and picture Jesus with both arms directly over his head with one nail fastening
				both wrists to a wooden pole or stake which has no cross beam.  Though the Greek word "<i>stauros</i>" can mean "<i>stake</i>" the JW idea
				is nevertheless incorrect.  David Reed points out that <b>John 20:25</b> where Thomas says he wants to "<i>see in his hands the print of
				the nails</i>” defeats this view (<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>, pp. 82-83).  Thomas knew that there was more than
				one nail holding Jesus’ hands on the cross which certainly implies they were outstretched rather than brought together. Though this is not
				a vital doctrine in itself, it demonstrates the Watchtower’s willingness to change the words of Scripture based on preference rather than
				evidence.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another interesting discrepancy is how <b>Hebrews 1:6</b> changed between the 1970
				(and earlier) edition and the 1971 edition.  Ron Rhodes (<i>The Ten Most Important Things...</i>, p. 26) comments that early on the
				Watchtower Society approved the act of worshipping Jesus.  However, in 1959 that began to change and by 1964 they declared that doing this
				was absolutely wrong.  All the NWT editions previous to 1971 translated <b>Hebrews 1:6</b> "<i>... And let all God’s angels worship
				him.</i>"  The subsequent editions say "<i>... And let all God’s angels do obeisance to him</i>".  Once again we note that though the
				Greek root word "<i>proskuneo</i>" can mean either, it is revealing that the word was changed in response to a shift in beliefs.
				Shouldn’t our doctrine be based on the Word rather than the other way around?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, one of the Watchtower’s chief claims for the NWT is that it has "restored"
				the proper name for God ("Jehovah") throughout.  Note the following quote from the Introduction to the 1984 edition:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Therefore the foremost feature of this translation is the restoration of the divine name to its rightful place in the English
					text</i> (p. 6).
				</blockquote>
				What is interesting about that is that they use it 237 times in the New Testament even though the tetragrammaton YHWH (vowels are added
				to produce Jehovah or Yahweh) never once occurs in the Greek manuscripts.  The JW claim is that these manuscripts have been tampered with
				and they cite several bits of evidence which Walter Martin ably refutes (see <i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 74).  In effect they have
				taken the Greek words for Lord (<i>kyrios</i>) and God (<i>theos</i>) and translated them "<i>Jehovah</i>" though there is no
				justification for doing so.  But the real problem is that because of their underlying bias they cannot even accomplish this "<i>foremost
				feature</i>" with consistency.  Consider <b>Romans 14:7-9</b> which uses the Greek word for "<i>Lord</i>" four times.  If it were consistent,
				the NWT would use the word "<i>Jehovah</i>" four times but it does not.  It does on the first three occasions but the last one which is
				connected to Jesus is left as "<i>Lord</i>".  The Watchtower is caught between a rock and a hard place.  By leaving it as they have they have
				manufactured a "disconnect" between <b>vv. 7-8</b> and <b>v. 9</b>.  In the former we "<i>live ... die ... belong to Jehovah</i>" but in
				the latter "<i>Christ</i>" out of nowhere appears to become "<i>Lord over ... the dead and the living</i>".  The flow of the verses makes
				no sense at all.  However, that must certainly be preferrable to the other option of consistency which would read as: "<i>For to this end
				Christ died and came to life again, that he might be <b>Jehovah</b> over both the dead and the living</i>.”  As David Reed writes concerning
				this, that is "<i>a thought totally unacceptable in Watchtower theology</i>" (<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>, pp.
				91-92).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For these (and many other unmentioned) reasons we must conclude that the NWT is not
				very reliable at all.  Far from being the most correct and, in their view, the only true Word from God, it is not of His making at all.
				Sadly, it is a tool being used by its manufacturers to dupe the unwary into believing a perverted form of the Gospel.  Though many
				sincerely believe that it is the path to life, it is instead the way of death.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Theology and Teachings (with Rebuttal): Salvation</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For all practical purposes this is the most important doctrine of all.  The answer to the
				Philippian jailer’s piercing, bottom-line question in <b>Acts 16:30</b> -- "<i>Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</i>" -- must be correct or
				else all is lost and no amount of theological learning or debate will make any difference.  What then do Jehovah’s Witnesses believe about
				how to be saved and experience eternal life?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, we must note that a lot of what JW’s say sounds a lot like what Christians believe.
				Herbert Kern quotes <i>Make Sure of All Things</i>  (pp. 438-39) as stating that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Salvation possible only through faith in Jesus Christ.  Salvation not earned so that it is due us; an expression of undeserved
					kindness</i> (<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 35).
				</blockquote>
				The trouble is they do not mean the same things we do by the terms they use.  As we have seen previously, the first problem has to do with
				their conception of Jesus Christ.  In their view, he was only a man, not God in the flesh.  Therefore when he died his sacrifice only
				restored what we lost when Adam sinned.  Adam’s fall affected us in that we lost perfection and the privileges it conferred.  Since Adam
				was perfect when he sinned, so did Jesus have to be when he died but it only "<i>exactly corresponded in value</i>" (<i>Things In Which It
				is Impossible for God to Lie</i>, p. 232 as quoted by Hebert Kern, p. 35) or, in other words, Jesus’ sacrifice only paid for Adam’s sin.
				In accomplishing that he restored to us the chance to be saved.  A tract published by the American Tract Society quotes two passages from
				<i>Studies in the Scriptures</i>:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Christ’s death only purchased for mankind the earthly life and earthly blessings lost when Adam sinned</i> (Vol. 5, p. 145);
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<i>Christ’s death only provides an opportunity for a person to attain eternal life through obeying God’s laws.  There is no assurance of
					eternal life</i> (Vol. 1, pp. 150, 152).
				</blockquote>
				So when JW’s talk about the "<i>free gift</i>" that Christ provided they are referring to the fact that in his actions he gave us the
				<i><b>chance</b></i> to now earn eternal life through obedience by removing the sin we inherited from Adam.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>** Note:</b>  One passage they use to show Jesus was only a perfect man is <b>I Timothy
				2:5,6</b>.  They claim that a mediator is, by definition, someone who is separate from those who need the mediation -- in this case, God
				and mankind.  Since God is one of the parties involved in the mediation, Jesus cannot be God.  The fallacy of this logic is evident
				immediately because it must also then be true that Jesus cannot be a man for mankind is also part of this mediation.  But since the verse
				says Jesus is a man and is called the mediator, why can’t He also be mediator as God?  In fact it is precisely because He is both that He
				could qualify to be the mediator (Ron Rhodes, <i>The Ten Most Important Things You Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witness</i>, p. 81).  It is clear
				then that JW’s actually promote a system of good works to earn salvation.  Four specific areas are outlined in <i>From Paradise Lost to
				Paradise Regained</i> (pp. 242-249).  To have eternal life one must:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Study the Bible (presumably with the aid of Watchtower publications);
					</li>
					<li>
						Meet regularly and associate primarily with other Jehovah’s Witnesses;
					</li>
					<li>
						Bring his life into conformity with the teachings of the Bible as interpreted by JW’s including being baptized into their
						organization;
					</li>
					<li>
						Be an active witness especially through door-to-door proselytizing and literature distribution.
					</li>
				</ol>
				(Cf. Hebert Kerns comments on pp. 7-8 of <i>How To Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Without getting too much into JW’s eschatology, the hope of the JW is that he will be
				found faithful enough in doing good to be raised when paradise is finally restored to earth.  We need to understand that to them "being
				resurrected" does not mean that their earthly bodies will be raised and reunited with their spirits as Christians believe.  To a JW when
				they die, they cease to exist.
				<blockquote>
					<i>A person’s soul is an inseparable part of the body, so that when a person dies there is no continued existence of the soul</i>
					(<i>Make Sure of All Things</i>, pp. 349, 352 as quoted by American Tract Society).
				</blockquote>
				This condition necessitates that they be completely remade.
				<blockquote>
					<i>Since there is no continued existence of the soul after death, Jehovah’s Witnesses who die will eventually be recreated from Jehovah’s
					memory to inhabit His kingdom</i> (Ibid., p. 311 as quoted by the American Tract Society).
				</blockquote>
				For the majority of people then, death is the end for most will not be raised since they either did not do the things JW’s think necessary
				for salvation at all or simply were not faithful enough.  For those that are "raised", however, there is yet more to do.  They must continue
				to serve during a thousand year period of time after which Satan will be released to tempt them.  If they fail at any point, they will be
				annihilated.  Those who pass these tests with unstinting obedience will finally be granted to live in the earthly paradise forever.  This
				is why they cannot be sure that they will be granted eternal life -- they can never know if they’ve done enough or if they will pass the
				tests to come.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>** Note:</b>  The major verse that JW’s use to defend their view that salvation is
				gained through obedience and good works is <b>Philippians 2:12</b> in which Paul writes for his readers to "<i>work out your own salvation
				with fear and trembling</i>".  From this they assert that Paul is saying that people must do good works (obey God) in order to obtain
				salvation.  Believing that God’s Word never contradicts itself and in light of Paul’s other writings such as <b>Romans 3:20; 4:1-5;
				Galatians 2:16</b>; and <b>Ephesians 2:8,9</b> (among many others) it is impossible that Paul is teaching salvation by works in
				<b>Philippians 2:12</b>.  What is he talking about then?  Remember that Paul is speaking to a church and encouraging them in their conduct
				(<b>1:27</b>).  In other words, to a group of people who have already been saved.  He is concerned that their behavior not bring reproach
				upon Christ nor cause each other to stumble (<b>2:1-4</b>).  He is telling them to work <i><b>out</b></i> their salvation, not work
				<i><b>for</b></i> their salvation.  In other words, he is reminding them that their behavior should reflect their belief.  This passage is
				about the process of sanctification (becoming more like Christ) not the instantaneous event of justification (removal of guilt).  When
				asked directly about what is required for salvation as in the previously cited <b>Acts 16:30-31</b> Paul replies, "<i>Believe on the Lord
				Jesus Christ, and you will be saved</i>".</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last item we will consider in this section has to do with the <b>144,000</b> (also
				called the Anointed Class or the "little flock" -- <b>Luke 12:32</b>).  JW’s teach that beginning with the twelve disciples, on to the
				other Christians of the first century A.D. and continuing until 1935, there were appointed a special class numbered at 144,000 (the number
				comes from <b>Rev. 7:4</b>).  These are the only ones who can expect to actually go to heaven to be with Jesus.  There they will have a
				spiritual existence and will reign with Christ over all the ones who will be in the restored paradise on earth (the "other sheep" --
				<b>John 10:16</b> or "great multitude" -- <b>Rev. 7:9</b>) who will have a physical existence.  Only those of the Anointed Class are said
				to be "born again" and called "sons of God".  Essentially, the JW’s teach of a people of God who are in two classes, elite and common.
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A quick look at <b>Revelation 7:4</b> tells us that the 144,000 which are sealed come
				from the twelve tribes of Israel.  JW’s contest this saying that it cannot be literal because Dan and Ephraim are omitted and Levi and
				Joseph are included, which is not usual.  (One might ask why they would take the 144,000 portion in the first half of the verse so literally
				if the second half is figurative.)  However, Ron Rhodes shares that in the Old Testament there are twenty variants of the list of the twelve
				tribes.  The list depended somewhat on the occasion and the context.  Dan and Ephraim were probably left out because they had serious
				problems with idolatry (<b>Judges 17-18</b>).  Levi was probably included because that tribe’s role as priests and temple servants is over
				now that Christ has come. (<i>The Ten Most Important Things</i>, pp. 88-90.)  Another problem they have is that in <b>Revelation 14:1-4</b>
				we see the 144,000 again who are said "<i>not to be defiled with women, for they are virgins</i>".  This would logically mean that all
				144,000 are men, however JW’s insist that women are also included in that number.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding the "little flock" reference in <b>Luke 12:32</b>, again a quick look back to
				<b>v. 22</b> where Jesus started speaking shows that he was speaking to his small group of disciples instructing them not to worry about
				things they could not control but to serve God and trust Him for their needs.  There is no basis for connecting this to the 144,000 in
				Revelation and making it out to be an Anointed Class.  Furthermore the term "born again" in <b>John 3:3</b> is used by Christ to describe
				the spiritual birth that is available to <i><b>everyone</b></i> not just a special few.  Again, this is made clear in the context of the
				entire discussion, especially in <b>vv. 15-17</b>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Their idea about the "other sheep" of <b>John 10:16</b> is equally lame.  In the context
				we see that Jesus is speaking to a group of Jews (<b>v. 19</b>).  This in itself would imply that when Jesus speaks of "<i>other sheep ...
				not of this fold</i>" which would come and together would create "<i>one flock</i>" and have "<i>one shepherd</i>", He is speaking of the
				Gentiles. This is born out later in Acts when Peter is the first to take the gospel to the Gentiles and witnesses the conversion of
				Cornelius.  Later Paul becomes the apostle to the Gentiles and writes about the breaking of the "<i>middle wall of separation</i>" and the
				abolishment of the "<i>enmity</i>" between Jews and Gentiles that Christ accomplished by His sacrifice on the cross (<b>Eph. 2:11-18</b>).
				There is no link here to some group of God’s people who would be considered "have-nots" by comparison to the "elite" Anointed Class.  The
				other term for this same group -- "great multitude" - -is also defeated by simply reading the verse.  Supposedly, the great multitude is
				on earth but <b>Revelation 7:9</b> places them "<i>before the throne and before the Lamb</i>".  In <b>7:15</b> we see this same great
				multitude "<i>before the throne of God, and ... in His temple</i>".  Finally in <b>19:1</b> we see a great multitude "<i>in heaven</i>".
				(Cf. David Reed, <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>, p. 109-110.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again we see their teachings are full of errors and discrepancies when compared to God’s
				word, the Bible.  And when we are talking about this bottom-line question regarding what is required to be saved, it is important that we
				know the truth.  The truth is that we are saved by God’s grace when we place our faith in Jesus Christ, the One and Only Son of God who
				died not only for Adam’s sin but for the sin of us all.  His sacrifice satisfied God’s wrath so that we can be reconciled to the Father
				and be indwelt by the Holy Spirit and become a new creation.  Any good works we may do come because of grace and through the Spirit’s
				power; they do not earn us merit or favor with God.  That is the pure truth of the gospel of Christ.  We dare not stray from it.  We dare
				not neglect sharing it with others for it is their only hope.</font></p>

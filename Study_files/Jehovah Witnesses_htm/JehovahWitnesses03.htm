			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Organizational Practices and Terminology:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we have seen by examining the history of this group, the organization of the Jehovah’s
				Witnesses is centered primarily around its leadership.  Beginning with Russell, it was taught that one could not understand or receive God’s
				truth from the Bible without the accompanying aid of his instruction and teachings. This attitude continued with Rutherford.  The five
				presidents have had tremendous influence over the decisions and direction of the organization.  Each one has left his own distinctive mark
				as we have seen.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things have changed a bit in modern times.  Though the president is still appointed for
				life and usually has the final say on all matters, since the time of Rutherford there has existed a governing body of the Watchtower
				Society.  This board is now considered the "divine interpreter" for the Jehovah’s Witnesses rather than just the president (cf.
				<i>The Watchtower</i>, Oct. 1, 1967 quoted by Kern, <i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 43).  It is interesting to note that
				though the Society claims that God Himself was and is the direct source of all these men’s interpretations and teachings of the Bible, they
				frequently disagree and contradict each other, especially as leadership has passed from one generation to the next.  How can this be if God
				does not change (<b>Mal. 3:6</b>) and is not the author of confusion (<b>I Cor. 14:33</b>)?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus the control of this multi-million member organization is vested in the small group of
				men who run the show from Brooklyn, New York.  They are chosen from among the elite 144,000 who are still alive these days.  Here is something
				unique to this movement.  Drawing from <b>Revelation 7:4</b>, JW’s believe that God has chosen and appointed 144,000 servants to be His visible
				representatives on earth.  These are equated with the "faithful and wise servant" of <b>Matthew 24:45</b>.  They have been "assigned to dispense
				timely spiritual food" (<i>The Watchtower</i>, March 15, 1990 quoted by Kern, p.42) to the others in the movement.  These will merit a special
				reward (<b>Matthew 24:46-47</b>).  As of 1994, only about 8,600 JW’s considered themselves as part of that number (Kern, p. 41).  The rest have
				already died.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
				<blockquote>
					<b>**  Revelation 7:4-8 is clearly speaking of a remnant of Israel which God is going to seal.  It is obviously not referring to a
					special class within the JW’s.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					**  Matthew 24:45-47 is speaking of all who profess to be servants of the Lord.  Those who are true will be rewarded.  Those who are
					false will be punished.  There is no basis for taking this passage to refer to JW’s as the only means of God working in the present
					world.</b>
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, in essence, Jehovah’s Witnesses are divided into "haves" and "have-nots" with regard
				to salvation.  According to their theology, the 144,000 are the first class who will be given the privilege of being recreated (not
				resurrected and changed) as spirit beings just as Jesus was by God after His death.  They will also be allowed to rule with Jesus in
				Heaven.  The second class consists of all the other JW’s who do not attain to the 144,000.  They have no hope of ruling or being recreated
				as spirit beings.  Rather they will be recreated (again, not resurrected) with physical bodies to live on earth being ruled by Jesus and
				the 144,000. (A third class is all those outside JW’s who are nevertheless "good" enough to be given the opportunity to earn salvation
				[eternal life on earth].  They, too, will be recreated with physical bodies to live in the millennium.  But they can only go beyond the
				millennium if they attain perfection during it.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bottom line is that the "haves" who are fortunate enough or connected enough to be
				placed on the governing body rule with almost absolute authority over the daily practices of the members.  This is allowed because of the
				teachings that God’s truth and will can only be found through the teachings of the Watchtower Society (cf. <i>Cult Watch</i>, Question
				Six, p. 62).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Society justifies this stance by twisting scriptures, especially <b>II Peter
			1:20-21</b> and <b>Acts 8:30-31</b>.  They use the passage in <b>II Peter</b> to contend that no individual must ever try to <i>interpret</i> or
			figure out what the Bible is saying on his own.  But the Greek word for <i>interpretation</i> is <i>epilusis</i> which means "unloosing".
			The prophets did not loose these prophecies by themselves (<i>privately</i>).  It is speaking of the <b>origin</b> of prophecy in that it
			comes from God Himself through the Holy Spirit rather than merely from men (<b>cf. v. 21</b>).  It is not speaking at all about the proper
			and improper ways of interpreting the Bible but rather where the Bible came from.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The verses in <b>Acts 8</b> are used to argue how the eunuch could not understand until
				God’s servant showed him the truth.  Certainly we recognize that some portions of the Bible are more difficult than others to understand
				and sometimes we need help and instruction from others.  This is why God gave the Holy Spirit to help guide us  (<b>I Cor. 2:10-12</b>)
				and also gave teachers to the church (<b>Eph. 4:11</b>) for our edification, but it is quite a stretch to say that this passage endorses
				the Watchtower as the only true agent of God for all men.  A few points:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Philip was one man whom God used to guide the eunuch, he was not an organization.
					</li>
					<li>
						He taught him directly from the Old Testament scriptures, not with literature designed by an organization.
					</li>
					<li>
						After the baptism, the Holy Spirit caught Philip away from the eunuch who never had to join and submit to an organization.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<blockquote>
					><b>**  Question for your JW acquaintances:  "<i>If the Watchtower is the only true servant of God and the only means of really
					understanding God’s word and God’s will, and they did not come into existence until the late 1800’s, does this mean God had no
					representatives on earth for many centuries?  Did God not care whether or not people understood His word for all that time?</i></b>
					This question is intended to begin to create a seed of doubt in the mind of your acquaintance that the Watchtower is truly what it
					claims to be.  (Ron Rhodes, <i>The Ten Most Important Things You Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witness</i>, p.14.)
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The level of control of the Watchtower Society is astounding.  They regulate many aspects
				of their adherents’ lives.  For instance, they are not allowed to mingle with or have friends among Christian organizations who collectively
				are the evil servant in <b>Matthew 24:48-51</b> (cf. <i>Cult Watch</i>, Question 8, p. 63).  They are not to read the Bible apart from the
				literature of the Watchtower.  They are not allowed to celebrate most holidays (even Christmas and Easter) because of supposed pagan origins
				or associations or current day evil practices related to them (like gluttony); nor birthdays because they draw too much attention to the
				individual and the only birthday celebrations recorded in the Bible are of Pharaoh and Herod who were evil.  They are not allowed to do
				anything civil or patriotic (like voting, displaying or saluting a flag and joining the military) because these things are part of the
				evil world systems which are of Satan and used by him to trick people away from God.  They are not allowed to accept blood transfusions
				because of the misinterpretations of <b>Leviticus 17:10</b> and <b>Acts 15:29</b>.  However they are required to spend many hours each
				month doing door to door evangelism (ten on the average) and at least five hours each week at meetings and training sessions.  At these
				meetings they do not ask questions as this might arouse suspicion that they are thinking independently which is discouraged.  (Kern,
				<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, pp. 7-8; Reed, <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>, pp.122-25).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such is the culture of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.  They are used to accepting the word
				of the Watchtower as the absolute and final authority for their lives (cf. letter re: Clean Teeth in  <i>Awake!</i>, June 22, 2004, p. 30).
				This rigorous conformity is enforced by the threat of <i><b>disfellowshipping</b></i> those who do not toe the line of obedience.  In
				many cases this would mean complete separation from friends and family with the exception that if the disfellowshiped one is immediate
				family (spouse, son, daughter, etc.) you may conduct "necessary business" (David Reed, <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>,
				pp. 13, 121).  This is the most effective means of controlling the membership.  By the way, this sort of thing is not unique to Jehovah’s
				Witnesses.  Most religious cults are very concerned with power over the lives of their adherents and use some sort of manipulative
				coercion to keep them on board and in line.
				<blockquote>
					<b>**  Many of the publications which speak of witnessing to JW’s suggest that the first thing which must be done is to undermine
					the reliability and authority of the Watchtower.  This is done by planting seeds of doubt by showing them what the Bible really
					says when possible or asking questions as above (more on this later).</b>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Jehovah’s Witnesses actively claim the name of being Christian (indeed the only
				ones at that) and desire to be recognized as such by the general public, an examination of their beliefs will reveal that they are not.
				Whatever they may say about the Christian religion being corrupted and false through the centuries, the fact is that <i>Christianity</i>
				has always been characterized by certain beliefs (i.e., the Bible as the sole authority for faith and practice, the Trinity, the virgin
				birth of Christ, the dual and complete humanity and deity of Christ, the bodily death, resurrection, ascension and return of Christ,
				etc.).  When you leave these truths you become a believer in something else -- it is not Christianity.  Though they have a right to
				believe what they want, teach what they want and claim it is true, they cannot honestly claim to be Christian.  Their teachings and the
				teachings of Christianity clash on multiple points and are not compatible in any sense.  We will examine a few of the major collisions
				and may mention some others in passing.  I will seek to present each JW viewpoint honestly by using their own literature when possible
				(or at least references to their literature in my sources), which is more than they do for us as we will see.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Walter Martin states in his book <i>The Kingdom of the Cults</i> (p. 63) that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>every major cult and non-Christian religion which seeks to override orthodox theology continually attacks the doctrine of the
					Trinity.</i>
				</blockquote>
				In
				this regard Jehovah’s Witnesses are no exception and in fact are among the most aggressive in doing so.  In short, they teach that only
				Jehovah is God (they are careful to never refer to Him directly as the Father but rather say that <i>Jesus</i> called Him "<i>Father</i>");
				that Jesus is a separate and created being, not almighty God; and that the Holy Spirit is the impersonal, active force of God.  These
				teachings are not original with Charles Russell.  Martin notes that Arius of Alexandria taught that Jesus was the first creature and a
				second god, inferior to Jehovah God (p. 66).  This belief and Arius himself were banished from the church in A.D. 326 after the council of
				Nicaea formulated and established the doctrine of the Trinity based on teachings of the Scriptures.  Remember that Russell was influenced
				by a group called the Christadelphians around 1870 who echoed the Arian heresy.  Jehovah’s Witnesses offer several points to make their
				argument against the traditional Christian doctrine of the Trinity.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>First</b>, they assert that the term <i>trinity</i> is found nowhere in the Bible nor
				is it clearly taught there (cf. <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i>, 1989, pp. 6, 12).  To them these are significant points.  Based
				upon this they then claim that both the term and the teaching are man-made and were constructed hundreds of years after the time of Christ
				and the Apostles.  Thus it is a corruption of the true Christian faith and patently false.  However, they purposefully misrepresent the
				concept of the Trinity to make the denial of it more acceptable.  For instance, in <i>Studies in the Scriptures</i>, Charles Russell refers
				to it as "<i>this doctrine of three Gods in one God</i>" and later as "<i>three Gods in one person</i>" (quoted by Ron Rhodes, <i>The 10
				Most Important Things You Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witness</i>, p. 65).  Neither of these statements is accurate with regard to what
				Trinitarians believe.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rebuttal:</b> Rhodes submits in response to this that JW’s need to be reminded that,
				strictly speaking, neither does the word "<i>Jehovah</i>" appear in the Hebrew or Greek manuscripts of the Bible ( p. 64.)  It is a word
				constructed by taking the first three vowels from the Hebrew word for ‘Lord’ (<i>Adonai</i>) and inserting them into the consonants YHWH
				resulting in <i>Yahowah</i> or <i>Jehovah</i>.  The Jews did this to make a substitute for God’s name so as to not accidentally break the
				third commandment.  So is the doctrine of Jehovah in the Bible false because that name does not actually appear?  Of course not.  Just so
				we must not ask if the constructed word which describes a doctrine is in the Bible but whether the doctrine or concept itself is there.
				As we continue we will see that though no writer of the Scriptures laid out the doctrine of the Trinity as such, it is indelibly,
				continuously and effortlessly portrayed throughout the Bible. So much so that, as previously noted, when heretics like Arius arose, the
				clear teachings of the Bible refuted them.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Christian concept of the Trinity is that:
				<ol>
					<li>
						There is only one true God (<b>Deut. 6:4; Isaiah 44:6; 46:9; I Corinthians 8:4; James 2:19</b>).
					</li>
					<li>
						There are three Persons who are this one God -- the Father (<b>Malachi 2:10</b>); Jesus the Son (<b>John 20:28</b>); and the Holy
						Spirit (<b>John 16:13; Acts 5:3,4; 13:2</b>).
					</li>
					<li>
						There is a three-in-oneness in this Godhead (<b>Matthew 28:19</b> -- cf. Rhodes, p. 68).
					</li>
				</ol>
				Each of the three Persons, on different occasions in the Bible, is credited with divine attributes such as omnipresence, omniscience,
				omnipotence, perfect holiness and eternality (For a complete listing of these attributes and corresponding Bible references see Rhodes,
				p. 67;  also see Herbert Kern, <i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, pp. 31-32 for related material).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One note that may help us is that the Hebrew has more than one word for "one".  One term
				is "<i>yachid</i>" which means "<i>the only one</i>" in an absolute or solitary sense (i.e. <b>Gen. 22:2</b>).  The other is "<i>echod</i>"
				which does not connote absolute unity but rather a composite unity (i.e. <b>Genesis 2:24</b> "<i>one flesh</i>"; <b>Numbers 13:23</b>
				"<i>one cluster of grapes</i>").  It is this second word which is used in <b>Deuteronomy 6:4</b>.  Thus, the implication in that language
				is that our God is a composite or unity of persons.  (Explain Walter Martin’s [pp. 69-70] argument from <b>Genesis 18:16-22; John 1:18;
				5:37</b>; and <b>Genesis 19:1, 24</b> in response to JW’s question "<i>If Jesus was Jehovah incarnate then who was in heaven when he was
				on the cross?</i>”).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>second</b> major argument of the Jehovah’s Witnesses against the doctrine of the
				Trinity is that this belief is rooted in paganism and is the work of the devil.  This falls in line with their rejection of all Christian
				denominations and organizations as being tools of the devil.  Essentially the idea is that the worship of pagan gods grouped in threes
				(<i>triads</i>) goes back as far as Babylonia and Assyria.  Later other cultures such as Egypt, Greece and Rome were also influenced by
				this and after the death of the apostles these heathen practices began to invade Christianity.  The leaders in the fourth century A.D.
				began to make concessions to appease the masses and eventually codified a belief in the Trinity.  This was part of an overall apostasy
				(falling away from the true faith) and lawlessness by the church at large.  Other doctrines which also began to be accepted at this time
				by these false followers of Christ (according to them) were the belief in hell and the immortality of the soul (cf. <i>Should You Believe
				in the Trinity?</i>, 1989, pp. 7-12).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rebuttal:</b>  Certainly we would agree that the worship of false gods was prevalent
				all around the early church.  But the idea that there was a focus on triads of gods in all these places at the time Christianity emerged
				is not true.  Rhodes points out that this idea of a triumvirate of gods was especially popular in Babylon and Assyria and further east
				about 2000 years before Christianity began.  He comments that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>from a historical and geographical perspective, the suggestion that Christianity borrowed the Trinitarian concept from pagans is
					quite unfeasible</i> (<i>The 10 Most Important Things</i>, p. 69).
				</blockquote></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It should also be noted that these triads were <i>separate gods</i> in the minds of
				the people who worshipped them.  They were polytheists who believed in many different beings and gods who ruled the cosmos.  The idea
				and worship of multiple gods was (and still is to some degree) common in the world.  However, the doctrine of the Trinity maintains that
				there is only <i>one God</i> consisting of <i>three Persons</i>.  It is unique in what it contends which implies that it was not made
				up by man at all.  Rather it is simply the result of what has been communicated to us by God about Himself.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, Rhodes mentions that there are other concepts among the heathen which could
				be said to be similar to what Christians believe.  For instance, some pagan religions teach of a great flood, while others believe in a
				messiah-like figure (“<i>Tammuz</i>”) who was resurrected.  Following Watchtower logic, do we also throw out the biblical teachings of
				Noah’s flood, Jesus the Messiah and His resurrection? Just because you can find something in paganism that remotely resembles a
				Christian doctrine doesn’t mean it was borrowed from the false religion.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Third</b>, and perhaps most importantly to the JW’s, the doctrine of the Trinity
				must be false because it doesn’t make sense.  As you talk with JW’s and read their literature, it will be seen that they place much
				emphasis on the <i>reasonableness</i> of things pertaining to God.  Walter Martin says that:
				<blockquote>
					<i>reason has always been ‘the great god’ before whom (they) ... bow with unmatched reverence</i>" (<i>Kingdom</i>, p. 63).  In s
					upporting this attitude they often refer to <b>Isaiah 1:18a</b> "<i>Come now and let us reason together.</i>"  From this partial
					verse they teach that "<i>Jehovah God by His Word furnishes us with ample reasons and logical bases for all regarding which he
					expects us to exercise faith ... We can make sure of what is right only by a process of reasoning on God’s Word</i> (<i>The
					Watchtower</i>, January 1, 1973, p. 24 quoted by Martin, <i>Kingdom</i>, p. 65).
				</blockquote>
				This approach is especially apparent concerning the doctrine of the Trinity which even we, as Christians who believe it, admit
				that we cannot comprehend it fully.  Knowing this, they hit the issue hard with this argument of reason (cf. <i>Should You Believe in the
				Trinity?</i>, 1989, pp. 4-5, 30).  Sadly, this method is effective with many for the simple fact that people like to feel as if they can
				understand things.  Why muddle things up with an incomprehensible teaching like the Trinity?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In connection with this they also often quote <b>I Corinthians 14:33</b> which says that
				"<i>God is not the author of confusion</i>".  Since the doctrine of the Trinity is confusing, it must not be from God but made up instead
				by man.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rebuttal:</b>  There are several areas where this idea can be attacked.  First, of
				course, we must consider what the scriptures say about this matter.  With regard to <b>Isaiah 1:18</b> it is readily apparent that when
				God was inviting His people to "<i>reason together</i>" it was about the matter of forgiveness and salvation.  The context of the chapter
				is rebuke, warning, instruction and invitation to Israel.  He was appealing to their common sense of wanting to avoid His wrath through
				obedience.  Indeed, God does appeal to our reason and thinking faculties.  He does make Himself known and understood -- how else could
				we respond to Him or seek to obey?  But He is not inviting us to investigate His nature and seek a full understanding of Him. The thought
				of us mortal creatures understanding our God the infinite Creator is ludicrous.  The Bible makes this abundantly clear in <b>Isaiah 55:8,9;
				Romans 11:33; and I Corinthians 13:12</b>.  With regard to <b>I Corinthians 14:33</b> the context is also completely foreign to how the
				JW’s want to apply it.  Obviously Paul is writing about the disorder and confusion in the Corinthian church services due to the misuse of
				some spiritual gifts.  He is not saying that any doctrine which challenges our understanding is inherently false and not of God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second we must consider whether the idea that God always gives us reasons for what He
				asks us to believe is true.  The Bible is invaluable in many ways for explaining why things in the world are the way they are.  But even
				the Bible does not give us reasons for everything.  For instance, does God ever explain why He created Lucifer and allowed him to rebel
				and have the freedom to cause Adam and Eve to fall into sin?  No.  It is not <i>reasonable</i> to us that God should do this but we are
				told that He did.  Should we throw it out because it doesn’t make sense?  Or do we believe what the Bible says?  Another example of this
				might be when a tragedy strikes us personally does God contact us to tell us why He allowed the evil thing to happen?  No.  He simply
				tells us in <b>Romans 8:28</b> that "<i>all things work together for good</i>" and asks us to believe that it is in accordance with His
				divine plan.  Do we refuse to believe when we can’t make sense of it?  Or do we continue to walk with God and trust Him?  There is much
				about God and what he does that we cannot understand and may never fully comprehend, just as a very small child does not fully understand
				all that his own father is and does.  Yet he loves and trusts him anyway.  Still another example might be the miracles of God.  Must we
				require that God explain to us how He accomplishes His miracles before we accept them?  The Jehovah’s Witnesses do not require that for
				they claim to believe in miracles.  Why then do they reject what God claims for His own nature?  To think we must understand something
				before we can accept it is in itself unreasonable.  (Cf.  <i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 66-67 re: scientist’s views of light energy.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To conclude this section we would refer to a remark from John Ankerberg and John
				Weldon that with regard to confusion, <i>not believing in the Trinity</i> will cause many verses in the Bible to not make good sense
				(<i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 67).  Among these are: <b>Genesis 1:26; 11:7,9; Matthew 28:19; II Corinthians 1:21,22; 13:14; Ephesians 3:11-16;
				4:4-6; I Thessalonians 1:1-5</b>.  It is clear that the doctrine of the Trinity is biblical, unambiguous and certainly believable if
				your God is great enough.</font></p>

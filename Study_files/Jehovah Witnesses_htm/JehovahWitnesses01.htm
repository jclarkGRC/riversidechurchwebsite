			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Introduction:</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following study is an examination of the history, organization, beliefs and practices
				of the religious sect known generally as Jehovah’s Witnesses.  At the conclusion of this critical evaluation we will also consider the best
				ways and approaches to share the true gospel of Christ with members of this cult.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first question that might be raised relates to the reasons for targeting this group
				for such a study or, in other words, "<i>Why pick on them?</i>"  Here are a few reasons that come readily to mind:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Their <i>aggressive proselytizing</i> in which they focus on trying to persuade spiritually immature Christians to join their group
						(cf. excerpt from W.J. Schnell’s <i>Thirty Years a Watchtower Slave</i> quoted by Walter Martin in <i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>,
						p. 125).  It is quite likely that most of us will come into contact with one or more JW’s doing this work and we should be prepared.
					</li>
					<li>
						Their claim of <i>accurately presenting</i> the truth of the Bible and to being Christian in their doctrine needs to be examined
						and evaluated especially in light of ...
					</li>
					<li>
						Their astounding claim to be <i>alone</i> in <i>purveying</i> God’s truth so that only they can reveal the true message of God
						from the Bible.
					</li>
				</ol>
				Although various Christian denominations and groups disagree on points of theology, rarely, if ever, do they claim to be the exclusive
				possessors of God’s truth.  As Jehovah’s Witnesses do claim this (cf. excerpt from the Sept. 15, 1910 edition of <i>The Watchtower</i>
				quoted in <i>Kingdom of the Cults</i>, p. 46) and at the same time claim to be Christian, we need to determine the validity of their
				claims.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My sources for the following critique are chiefly:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>The Kingdom of the Cults</i> by Walter Martin;
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Cult Watch</i> by John Ankerberg and John Weldon;
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Handbook of Today’s Religions</i> by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart;
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>The Ten Most Important Things You Can Say</i> to a Jehovah’s Witness by Ron Rhodes;
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>How To Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i> by Herbert Kern;
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse</i> by Verse by David Reed (an ex-JW himself);
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Pastor Charles Taze Russell</i> by David Horowitz,
					</li>
					<li>
						along with several other booklets, articles, pamphlets and a few Watchtower Society publications which will be referred to as
						needed.
					</li>
				</ul>
				I would encourage the interested reader to acquire one or more of these references for further study (Martin’s book is especially good
				for a scholarly doctrinal treatment while likewise Rhodes and Reed are helpful with regard to interaction with JW’s).</font></p>

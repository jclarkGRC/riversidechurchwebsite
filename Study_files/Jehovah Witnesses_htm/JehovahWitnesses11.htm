			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In continuing this section on the unreliability of the Watchtower Society, we need to
				examine their record in the matter of prophecy.  First, we ought to take a look at what the Watchtower claims for itself with regard to
				being the prophetic voice of God.  Both Herbert Kern (<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, p. 49) and David Reed (<i>Jehovah’s
				Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>, pp. 30-31) cite the April 1, 1972 edition of The Watchtower which says:
				<blockquote>
					<i>So does Jehovah have a prophet to help them, to warn them of dangers and declare things to come? ... These questions can be answered
					in the affirmative.  Who is this prophet? ... This ‘prophet’ is not one man, but was a body of men and women.  It was the small group
					of foot-step followers of Jesus Christ, known at that time as International Bible Students.  Today they are known as Jehovah’s
					Christian Witnesses</i> (p. 197).
				</blockquote>
				This is not the only occasion that the leaders of this movement have made such a claim in this magazine, not to mention other publications.
				It is clear that the Society believes this organization to be the mouthpiece of God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In another edition of <i>The Watchtower</i> (March 1, 1975, p. 151) the Watchtower
				declared what the credentials are for a legitimate prophet which, to their credit, are biblical and based on <b>Deuteronomy 18:20-23</b>
				(<i>Cult Watch</i>, p. 80).  In a nutshell, the requirement is that anything and everything that the prophet says in the name of God must
				come to pass, or else the prophet is false.  Such a false prophet should not be feared nor heeded.  We certainly agree with that standard
				for we believe that a person who speaks for God in a prophetical way is being given direct revelation from God who cannot be wrong.
				Therefore what is said must certainly come to pass if it is a real prophecy from a genuine prophet.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The question, then, is:  <i>Have all of the prophecies issued from this organization and
				its leaders come to pass?</i>  Let us see.  As we saw in the historical section of this study, Charles Russell made many bold predictions
				regarding the coming of Christ and the subsequent Battle of Armageddon which would result in the overthrow of all earthly rulers and the
				annihilation of all except the members of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.  His first teaching was that Christ had returned invisibly in 1874.
				This was upheld as the official teaching for the first fifty years and was confirmed by Judge Rutherford in his book <i>Prophecy</i>
				(p.65 as cited by David Reed, <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered...</i>, p. 54).  Russell also taught that, based on the measurements of
				the "divinely inspired" Great Pyramid (he converted inches into years) that the Battle of Armageddon would end in 1914 and the kingdom
				of God would be fully established upon the earth.  Obviously this did not come true.  (Reed also notes in his book [p. 54] that the
				current teaching is that Jesus returned invisibly in 1914.  The original 1874 date is ignored entirely, most likely to distance themselves
				from Russell and to explain away the failure of Jesus to appear in 1914.  Does a true prophet change his story like this?)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not to be outdone, Rutherford, who assumed leadership after Russell died in 1916, and
				the Watchtower prophesied in the 1920 publication <i>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</i> that the kingdom of God would be established
				in 1925 and would be marked by the resurrection of "<i>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the faithful prophets of old</i>" (p. 90 cited by
				Reed, p. 31).  That did not come to pass either.  They even built a house in San Diego which they named "<i>Beth Sharim</i>" in 1930
				for the purpose of giving these soon-to-be resurrected saints a place to live.  Rutherford, in the meantime, moved in and was to live
				there until they appeared (Reed, pp. 111-112).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More recently the Watchtower pushed 1975 as the year it would finally all be over.
				This prophecy was revealed in the August 15, 1968 edition of The Watchtower in an article entitled "<i>Why Are You Looking Forward to
				1975?</i>"  They also made reports of "<i>... brothers selling their homes and property and planning to finish out the rest of their days
				in this old system in the pioneer service</i>" (<i>Kingdom Ministry</i>, 1974, p. 3 cited by Herbert Kern, <i>How To Respond...</i>,
				p. 48).  It looks like the "old system" is pretty much still in place now thirty years later.  Both Herbert Kern (pp. 46-48) and the
				authors of <i>Cult Watch</i> (pp. 81-84) list other instances (some related to these and some altogether different) where the Watchtower
				made predictions and implications about the end times but all failed.  According to their own standards based on the passage cited in
				<b>Deuteronomy</b>, there is no choice but to label the Watchtower as a false prophet.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is the JW response to this?  It may depend who you’re speaking to and how they are
				trained.  If you are talking to an ordinary member, for instance, it may be that they will admit that all those false prophecies were
				"<i>mistakes</i>" but that the Watchtower has learned its lesson and does not do that anymore.  If that is the case have them reference
				the inside cover of <i>Awake!</i> where in the purpose statement it says:
				<blockquote>
					<i>Most important, this magazine builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world that is <b>about</b>
					to replace the present wicked, lawless system of things</i> (emphasis added).
				</blockquote>
				David Reed notes that as recently as 1986 they still referenced 1914 in that statement (<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>,
				p. 32).  Though it seems they have learned a lesson about fixing specific dates to their prophecies, they are still heavily emphasizing
				the end of time. You may also encounter JW’s like Herbert Kern who says that those
				<blockquote>
					<i>who come to our door are trained to deny that their leaders ever predicted the date of Armageddon</i> (<i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s
					Witnesses</i>, p. 48.)
				</blockquote>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are talking to a leader, there are several possibilities of response.  They may:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Admit to the mistake but quickly say that biblical characters like Moses, Peter and Paul also blundered at times and, after all,
						no person or organization is perfect.
						<blockquote>
							Do not fall for this switch.  It is true that these servants of God made mistakes (sinned) in their personal lives -- as do
							all people.  But it is quite another thing to say that in their transmission of God’s direct revelation, they made mistakes.
							There is nothing to substantiate such a claim and no true Christian believes that.  No portion of the Bible has ever been
							documented to be wrong.  However, as we have seen, the prophecies of the JW’s have been.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						They may speak of "adjustments" that needed to be made and use the phrase that "<i>the light is getting brighter</i>".  In other
						words, because they have more light today they are able to see where their previous claims were off a bit.
						<blockquote>
							Again this a type of switch.  Yes, people today have more light via the New Testament, archaeology, and so on.  But this
							light only helps us <b>understand</b> more correctly what God has already said through His prophets.  Prophets do not need
							more light because they are getting their information from the Source of light.  It is not dark where God is.  A true
							prophecy may be misunderstood for a while, but more light reveals why it was correct the whole time. A real prophecy does
							not need an "adjustment".
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						A person in authority may blame the rank and file for not getting the gist of what the Watchtower was saying.  He may dismiss
						the whole thing as a case of the general membership being "<i>overzealous, overanxious, or misunderstanding the Scriptures</i>".
						In other words, the whole thing was blown out of proportion by a well-meaning but ignorant group of followers.
					</li>
					<li>
						Or they may try to plead their case based on a technicality.  Some leaders of the Watchtower have insisted that they never
						officially used the phrase "<i>These are the words of Jehovah</i>" and thus these were not really prophecies at all.  But they
						cannot have it both ways.  They have claimed to be the one, true source for God’s revelation.  Is it true or not?   You cannot
						declare that you speak for God and then hedge when you are proven wrong.  (Kern, <i>How to Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>,
						pp. 48-49.)
					</li>
				</ol>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What absolutely reveals their lack of character and trustworthiness in all this is that
				they will make these excuses in spite of the fact that they have already officially acknowledged that they were wrong about the prophecies.
				The authors of <i>Cult Watch</i> (p. 84) cite a 1975 publication <i>Man’s Salvation</i> and two editions of the <i>Yearbook of Jehovah’s
				Witnesses</i> (1975, 1980) in which they admit the Russell prophecy regarding 1874 was incorrect as well as the predictions for 1914, 1925,
				and 1975.  So by their own words they are shown to be false prophets who have presumed to speak for God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Can the Watchtower be trusted to guide a person’s soul safely to the hereafter?  Are
				the doctrines they have taught reliable and sure?  Is what they say about God and the way He works true?  The unequivocal answer is a
				resounding <b>NO!</b>  The person who builds his life on what the Watchtower Society proclaims builds on quicksand.  It is a lie and a
				perversion of the true Gospel of Jesus Christ who as very God is the way, the truth and the life.</font></p>

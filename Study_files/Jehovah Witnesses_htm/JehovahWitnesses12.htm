			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are various benefits to a study such as this (like becoming inoculated to false
				doctrine through exposure to its errors, becoming more familiar with our own theology and the reasons for them, etc.) but the main
				<b>purpose</b> is to become more understanding of the Jehovah’s Witness mindset and beliefs so as to be more effective in witnessing to
				them.  Most of the time Christians have difficulty getting unbelievers interested in a conversation about spiritual matters, but in the
				door-to-door efforts of JW’s we actually have people coming to us with the intent of engaging us in a talk about God.  Therefore, we need
				to see the JW walking up our driveways as a ready-made opportunity for evangelism rather than a bothersome circumstance to be avoided at
				all costs.  Is it difficult to witness to a JW?  Yes.  Is it likely they will immediately recognize the validity of what a Christian is
				saying?  No.  For those trapped in this religious sect it is usually a long process of them working through the issues.  But Jesus did not
				tell us to witness only to those who are likely to listen.  He calls us to spread the seed of the Gospel freely.  One never knows what kind
				of ground even the simplest testimony for Christ will find.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To this end we want to share with you what some experts and former JW’s have recommended
				regarding how to witness to Jehovah’s Witnesses.  Since the following points are somewhat of a compilation from several sources and since
				many presented some of the same thoughts, I will not offer specific references after each point.  In lieu of that I will acknowledge that
				most of the material comes from the following authors and works:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Herbert Kern, <i>How To Respond to Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>, pp. 11-14.
					</li>
					<li>
						David Reed, <i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse</i>, pp. 113-117.
					</li>
					<li>
						Ron Rhodes, <i>The 10 Most Important Things You Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witness</i>, pp. 111-123.

				</ul>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, some "<i><b>Don’ts</b></i>":
				<ol>
					<li>
						Don’t memorize the above study material to use it to "blast away" at the next JW who comes to your door (or elsewhere).  You may
						win the battle but lose the war because the overwhelmed JW will run back to the elders for support and comfort.  They will patch
						him up with their false explanations and you will probably never see him again.  Thus, he will be reinforced for the next such
						encounter and you will never get to follow up with him.
					</li>
					<li>
						Don’t get sidetracked with minor issues.  For example, don’t bring up their refusal to celebrate holidays or birthdays, to take
						blood transfusions, be patriotic, etc.  Even some important doctrines (like the reality of hell) can be a side issue which
						distracts us from focusing on witnessing to the JW of Jesus.
					</li>
					<li>
						Don’t be condescending or overbearing.  Yes, what the JW at your door believes is wrong and you may have the truth but that is
						only by the grace of God.  Be friendly and courteous even as you disagree.  One writer suggests that JW’s get a lot of orders
						and bullying by their own elders and Christians should stand out in  contrast with a humble and loving spirit.
					</li>
					<li>
						Don’t begin by saying: "<i>I’m a Baptist, Methodist, etc.</i>" or "<i>I’m a member of (such and such) church</i>."  This only
						confirms for them that you are a member of the devil’s deceptive organization and they will be less likely to listen to what you
						have to say.  Instead, say, "<i>I’m a believer in Jesus</i>."  That is more likely to help them be open to discourse.
					</li>
					<li>
						Don’t try to talk about all the various doctrinal issues in 15 minutes.  It is not our calling to try to correct every wrong
						notion in a person’s head (whoever it may be).  Realize that a person can only absorb so much information in a certain amount
						of time.  As the saying goes, using a rifle-like style is more effective than a shotgun approach in witnessing to JW’s.  Try
						to emphasize one or two things.  Don’t let the discussion degenerate into a series of arguments.
					</li>
				</ol>
				</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, some "<i><b>Do’s</b></i>":
				<ol>
					<li>
						Do seek to have a <i>conversation</i> with your JW.  Realize that because they suffer so much rejection and apathy in their
						door-to-door visitation, they will be very open to your kind voice and willingness to talk.  Introduce yourself and ask for
						their names as well and use them throughout the conversation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Do set some guidelines for the conversation.  Tell them that you would be glad to talk about what the Bible teaches but are
						not interested in what their Watchtower literature has to say.  Emphasize that what the Watchtower declares is only the opinion
						of man while you are concerned with God’s words. In connection with this, refuse any attempt to give you Watchtower materials.
					</li>
					<li>
						Do be thorough when discussing a passage.  JW’s are trained to present a passage to "prove" their point and then hurriedly move
						on to another passage. Resist this and insist on examining the context of the passage which will usually reveal that the verse
						in question does not support their contention.
					</li>
					<li>
						Do make use of probing questions rather than pointed statements.  A person can easily shunt aside the assertions of a person he
						thinks is either misinformed or is the enemy, but he cannot ignore answers that he himself must provide to challenging questions.
						<blockquote>
							<b>**  For example:</b>  Often the JW’s will highlight the uncertainty of the world we live in and the fact that one day only
							a few will survive the coming destruction of the present world system.  They will talk about what must be done to be among
							those survivors.  Turn that around by asking them if they personally know <i>for sure beyond a shadow of a doubt right now</i>
							that they will be granted life in paradise forever.  If they are honest, they will tell you that they do not know for sure,
							or they will say that if they continue their good works they have high hopes or something similar.  That gives you the
							opportunity to tell them that you have that assurance and peace because of your faith in Christ.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<b>Or:</b>  Ask about JW history.  If they tell you that God restored Christianity in the 1800’s (or whenever) through the
							JW movement, ask them how God worked, or through what organization, between the times of the apostles and the coming of the
							JW’s.  Ask if they think God would not provide any way at all for untold millions of people to be saved for all those
							centuries.  Christians believe that people were saved by faith from the very beginning.  Since the time of Christ that faith
							must be placed in the Person and work of Jesus for complete forgiveness of sins.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<b>Or:</b> Ask if they think a person can be a Christian without reading Watchtower literature.  If they are honest, they
							will usually say no.  Ask them why God cannot speak to people through His own word without the aid of a publication of man.
							Ask them to try reading the Bible by itself without the Watchtower helps for a week or a month and let Jehovah speak to them
							directly through His word.  Suggest the Gospel of John if they take you up on it.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<b>Or:</b> Tell them you have heard that the Watchtower has made several false prophecies.  Ask them to elaborate and
							xplain.  When they have finished, ask about the passage in <b>Deuteronomy 18:20-23</b> and if they think the Watchtower has
							lived up to that standard.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<b>Or:</b>  If you are discussing a Bible verse, try to ask questions in a non-threatening way to make your point.  For
							instance, if the verse is <b>John 1:1</b> and they tell you their translation is right ("<i>the Word was a god</i>") because
							there is no definite article, simply mention that you have heard that the same is true of the word "<i>God</i>" in
							<b>vv. 6, 12-13, 18</b> (see section on deity of Christ).  Tell them you would have an easier time believing their translation
							if they can explain why it didn’t follow that same rule in those verses.  If they don’t know about that, ask them to find out.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							The point is to ask questions to make them have to think about the implications of their answers or make them go back and
							question the elders.  In this way hopefully you can plant a seed of doubt about the reliability of the Watchtower. It must
							be done with a loving spirit to be effective.  Hostility and antagonism will cause them to dismiss your questions.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						Do give your personal testimony of salvation in Christ if it is possible.  They will never be able to argue away how Jesus has
						changed your life and how He now works in it.  Refrain from being longwinded, but make sure they know that you are content in
						your relationship with Jesus and confident that He will see you safely through all possible troubles and even through death
						itself.
					</li>
					<li>
						Do pray.  This is most important and so I saved it for last.  Pray for God’s help when you see them coming up the street.  Pray
						for them after the visit.  If they are willing to read only the Bible for a time or come back and talk again later, pray for
						them regularly that the Holy Spirit will speak to them in the meantime.
					</li>

			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is God who draws and convicts.  We can only strive to plant or perhaps water but
				it is God who gives the increase.  You may feel frustrated after an encounter with a JW because of what you did or did not say, but we
				must trust God to pick up where we leave off.  Remember that the Lord can do much with just a little.  Be faithful to speak the truth in
				love and leave the rest in the hands of the Father.</font></p>

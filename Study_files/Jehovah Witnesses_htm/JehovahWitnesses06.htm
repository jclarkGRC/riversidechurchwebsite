			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Theology and Teachings (with Rebuttal): The Personality and Deity of the Holy Spirit</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since we have addressed the issues of the Trinity and the Deity of Christ, we should also
				take a look at what Jehovah’s Witnesses teach about the Holy Spirit.  In <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</i> (pp. 20-22), JW’s plainly
				make their case that the <i>holy spirit</i> (never capitalized by them) cannot be God or part of the Trinity because <i>it</i> isn’t even a
				person.  This publication (and others my sources cite such as <i>Reasoning from the Scriptures</i>, <i>Insights on the Scriptures</i> and
				<i>Let God Be True</i>) teaches the Holy Spirit is actually God’s <i>active force</i>.  This force is totally impersonal.  It is the raw
				power that God supplies to individuals so they can accomplish what He wants done.  JW’s compare it to electricity, radio waves and the like.
				Why do they teach this?  Because their rejection of the doctrine of Trinity requires it.  Their insistence that the Trinity cannot be true
				because it makes no sense means that they must find a way to also deny what the Bible teaches about the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do they justify this teaching?  By their usual method of either applying faulty logic
				to draw a reasonable sounding (but incorrect) conclusion or by twisting and  ignoring passages of the Bible which teach otherwise.
				<b>For instance</b>, JW’s try to make an argument from the fact that people are "<i>baptized</i>” with the Holy Spirit (<b>Matt. 3:11</b>),
				that the Holy Spirit will be "<i>poured out</i>" on people (<b>Joel 2:28</b>) and that people are "<i>filled</i>" with the Holy Spirit
				(<b>Acts 4:31</b>), therefore the Holy Spirit must be an impersonal force because how can a <i>person</i> be said to do those kinds of
				things.  A person simply cannot be split up and divided among or gushed all over multitudes of people -- it doesn’t make sense.  And
				furthermore, since the Holy Spirit is often linked with impersonal things like the "<i>fire</i>" in <b>Matthew 3:11</b> and in other
				places people are also "<i>full</i>" of "<i>wisdom</i>" (<b>Acts 6:3</b>), "<i>faith</i>" (<b>Acts 11:24</b>) and "<i>joy</i>"
				(<b>Acts 13:52</b>), it stands to reason that the Holy Spirit is likewise impersonal.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rebuttal:</b>  To answer this first line of reasoning, it must be noted that JW’s
				conveniently fail to acknowledge that there are other passages which also use such language in connection with other persons.  In
				<b>Job 10:10</b>, the longsuffering servant of God declared that he had been "<i>pour(ed) ... out like milk</i>".  Also Paul in
				<b>II Timothy 4:6</b> said that he was "<i>being poured out as a drink offering</i>".  Were Job and Paul therefore not real people
				with individual personalities?  Also with respect to the implied question of "<i>How can you be baptized with a person?</i>" we might
				also ask, in light of <b>Galatians 3:27</b>, how a believer can be "<i>baptized into Christ</i>" and how can he "<i>put on Christ</i>"?
				Does this mean Jesus was not a person?  And what about the passages in <b>Ephesians (1:23; 3:19; 4:10)</b> which speak of Christ and God
				filling pretty much everything, including believers?  Are God and Christ not persons either?  The answer to all these is that, of course,
				they (Job, Paul, Christ and God) do possess the attribute of personality.  This argument by the JW’s is flawed for two reasons:
				<ol>
					<li>
						There is no law of linguistics that says that certain verbs determine the nature of the nouns they are used with.  Human language
						communicates effectively with both literal and figurative usages.  To seek to establish the Holy Spirit as merely a force because
						of these words is ridiculous;
					</li>
					<li>
						The Holy Spirit is not limited to our concepts of what a person can or cannot do.  Because the Holy Spirit is God He is present
						everywhere at once, therefore, He, unlike humans, does have the capacity to be personally present in the life of each and every
						believer.
					</li>
				</ol>
				His abilities as a person are quite different and infinitely superior to our abilities.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Another</b> "proof" of this belief Jehovah’s Witnesses like to use is the fact that
				the Holy Spirit apparently has no personal name.  From the Bible we see that the Father has a personal name, Jehovah, and the Son’s
				personal name is Jesus, but nowhere do we see that the holy spirit has a name -- thus <i>it</i> must not be a person like the Father and
				the Son.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rebuttal:</b>  The silliness of this argument is evident.  There are many instances
				in the Bible where people are referred to but we are not given their personal names -- does this make them impersonal forces?  The same
				is true of most of the unclean spirits Jesus cast out and many of the angels mentioned in the scriptures -- are they also not individuals
				with personalities?  The Jehovah’s Witnesses do not make these assumptions.  Why not?  Because they are not interested in denying the
				personhood of people, angels or demons -- that doesn’t matter.  However they do want to deny that the Holy Spirit is a Person because if
				He is their theology has a big problem.  In reality the Holy Spirit does have a name.  Since He is God, His personal name is Jehovah (as
				well as all the other names the Bible reveals for the one true God which we’ll consider later).  <b>Matthew 28:19</b> shows that there is
				one "<b><i>name</i></b>" that is shared by three Personalities -- the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>final</b> JW argument we will consider is the pseudo-scholarly one which asserts
				that because the Greek word for "spirit" (<i>pneuma</i>) is a neuter noun it therefore requires a neuter pronoun such as "<i>it</i>" or
				"<i>itself</i>" to properly reflect the grammar.  They like to point to <b>Romans 8:16</b> (KJV -- "<i>The Spirit itself beareth
				witness</i> ... ") to illustrate their point and contend that the <i>holy spirit</i> is an <i>it</i> (notice, however, that what this
				"impersonal" Spirit is doing requires personality).  On the other hand, they say, the word "Helper""” (<i>parakletos</i>) which Jesus
				uses in <b>John 14:16, 26; 16:7-8</b> has a masculine gender and so it is natural that Jesus would use masculine pronouns when describing
				what the Helper would do (cf. <i>Should You Believe in the Trinity</i>, p. 22).  So they explain away references to the Spirit as a
				personal "<i>He</i>".</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Rebuttal:</b>  It is true that <i>pneuma</i> is neuter, not masculine and that
				<i>parakletos</i> is masculine but once again one cannot allow rules of grammar to determine the truth that is being communicated.
				For example, what about <b>Acts 4:24</b> which tells us that "<i>God is Spirit</i>".  Does this mean God is an "<i>it</i>" because the
				word for "Spirit" (<i>pneuma</i> again) is neuter?  But even more telling is the verse JW’s try to downplay or ignore.  After the logical
				explanation that the only reason Jesus uses "<i>He</i>" to describe the work of the Spirit in <b>John 16:7-8</b> is because "Helper" is
				masculine, we come to <b>v. 13</b>.  In that verse Jesus uses the neuter noun <i>pneuma</i> to refer to the Holy Spirit but then
				<i>continues</i> using the masculine personal pronoun to describe what He will do (again, notice the activities of the Holy Spirit which
				would seem to be beyond a mere <i>force</i> or <i>energy</i>).  One more note about this.  Ron Rhodes (<i>The Ten Most Important Things
				You Can Say to a Jehovah’s Witness</i>, p. 59) points out that JW’s may dismiss the use of the masculine "<i>He</i>"  as merely the
				personification of a thing just as <i>wisdom</i>, <i>sin</i> and <i>death</i> are in the Scriptures (cf. <i>Should You Believe in the
				Trinity?</i>, p. 21).  He suggests countering with <b>Acts 13:2</b> where the Holy Spirit speaks of Himself using personal pronouns like
				"<i>me</i>" and "<i>I</i>".</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now that we have addressed most of their arguments, let’s consider what the Bible reveals
				about the Holy Spirit.  Personal beings are usually thought to possess three attributes -- intelligence (ability to think); emotion (ability
				to feel); and will (ability to choose).  If the Holy Spirit is a Person then He should have all three.  Does the Bible reveal these things
				about Him?  I think it does.  With regard to His having intelligence (or a mind) consider the following passages:  <b>I Corinthians
				2:10-11</b> and <b>Romans 8:27</b>.  With regard to His emotions examine: <b>Romans 8:26</b> and <b>Ephesians 4:30</b>.  With regard to His
				ability to choose look at: <b>I Corinthians 12:11</b> and <b>Acts 13:2</b>.  The Bible’s testimony is that the Holy Spirit has all the
				necessary attributes.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But how do we know He is God?  Again we must look at what the Bible says about Him and
				what He does.  In <b>Genesis 1:2</b> we see that He was involved in the Creation.  <b>Psalm 139:7</b> tells us He is everywhere present.
				Compare <b>Isaiah 6:9</b> in which God is speaking and <b>Acts 28:25-26</b> in which the Speaker is more specifically identified as the
				Holy Spirit.  See again <b>Matthew 28:19</b> where the Holy Spirit is associated with the Father and the Son as having that one name.
				Look at how Peter declares in <b>Acts 5:1-4</b> that Ananias had lied to the Holy Spirit and in so doing had lied to God Himself. (We must
				ask: <i>Is it possible to lie to a force?</i>)  There are many more such passages describing the works of the Holy Spirit which can only
				be accomplished by God.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conclusion we reject the idea that the Holy Spirit is only God’s <i>active force</i>
				and assert that He is the Third Person of the Trinity, wholly and equally Almighty God, fully involved in all aspects of God’s plans and
				purposes.  It is He who regenerates us and indwells us and empowers us when we believe in Jesus Christ for salvation.</font></p>

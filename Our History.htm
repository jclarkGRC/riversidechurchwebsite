				<h2>Our History</h2>
				<p>New Hope traces its origins back to 1965 when Rev. Lloyd Plunkett was
					appointed by the National Home Missions Department to plant a Free Will
					Baptist church in the Seattle area. After moving here with his wife, 
					Betty, and getting started by making contact with interested parties, 
					advertising, visiting door-to-door and home prayer meetings, the first 
					official worship service was held on November 14, 1965.</p>
				<p>The church began to grow slowly but steadily and on February 26, 1967
					was officially organized as First Free Will Baptist Church of Seattle 
					with nineteen charter members. The group then purchased a church 
					building located in Burien. After this the church was able to grow more 
					rapidly. In July, 1976 Pastor Plunkett resigned and Rev. Millard Sasser 
					came to pastor the church the following January. The church continued to
					have success at reaching people with the gospel.</p>
				<p>Pastor Sasser resigned in May, 1978 and for a period of about two 
					years the church was unable to find a pastor. During this time the 
					church decided to move to the Kent area because most of the families 
					attending lived in that vicinity. The building in Burien was rented out 
					and eventually sold while the group met in various rented facilities. 
					Several preachers filled the pulpit during this time, most notably Rev. 
					Holt Seawell who became interim pastor from June to December 1980. All 
					these circumstances and other factors contributed to make this a 
					difficult period for the church.</p>
				<p>In December, 1980 Rev. Plunkett returned as pastor. Though still 
					renting meeting places, the church was able to purchase an older house 
					on two acres at 13414 SE 272nd St. on the east hill in Kent. The house 
					(aka “the Homestead”) was used as the parsonage for the Plunkett family 
					and as a meeting place for Wednesday night prayer services and church 
					activities. The church also eventually settled in at Kent Commons as a 
					regular, long-term meeting place for Sunday services. These developments
					afforded some stability and the church was able to rebound somewhat. It
					was during this period that the church decided to take the name New 
					Hope First Free Will Baptist Church.</p>
				<p>On November 15, 1992, after accepting a post from the FWB National 
					Foreign Missions Department, Pastor Plunkett resigned and left in May, 
					1993. The church called Rev. Brent Nix to be pastor and he and his 
					family came in September, 1993. After considering different options, the
					church decided to begin meeting in the former parsonage on Sundays 
					instead of renting. This necessitated extensive remodeling which was 
					largely completed in the fall of 1999. During this time growth was slow 
					but usually things were going in the right direction.</p>
				<p>At the same time the church began a savings campaign to build a fund 
					toward the construction of a larger meeting place on the property to 
					accomodate growth, Christian education and fellowship activities. God 
					blessed that effort and through sacrificial giving of the members and 
					generous gifts from outside sources the goal set was more than met. One 
					especially notable gift of $120,000 came in August, 2003 from the 
					Victory FWB Church in E. Wenatchee, WA which helped the fund reach 
					almost $300,000. Around that same time New Hope retained Integrated 
					Ministry and Facilities to help the church in the process of planning 
					and constructing a new building on the property. In December 2004, New 
					Hope applied for its first permits from the City of Kent. In the 
					meantime the church continued to preach and teach the Bible, disciple 
					its members, develop ministries and support missions and other 
					ministries as it could. Numerical growth was still slow but spiritual 
					growth and maturity among the members was steadily increasing. However, 
					the permit process with Kent was interminable despite constant input of 
					time, effort, money and prayer. It was confusing, frustrating and 
					discouraging at times.</p>
				<p>In early July, 2009 the church believed (at least the pastor did) 
					that finally permits were close at hand but at that point, through God’s
					providence, we discovered an existing church building in Sumner, WA 
					that was available for sale. The facilities proved to be perfect for the
					needs of the church and was in a good location (both for current 
					members and for future growth). Suddenly the delay of the permits became
					a positive rather than a negative. The purchase agreement between New 
					Hope and Edgewood Bible Church was closed on September 30, 2009. The 
					next four months were spent remodeling and the first Sunday service in 
					the Sumner facility was held on February 7, 2010.</p>
				<p>Our vision and our prayer is that God will use New Hope Free Will 
					Baptist Church to expand His kingdom here in Sumner and the surrounding 
					communities in north Pierce County and south King County.</p>
